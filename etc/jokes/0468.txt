PESSIMISM


A pessimist is a man who lives with an optimist.--_Francis Wilson_.


  How happy are the Pessimists!
    A bliss without alloy
  Is theirs when they have proved to us
    There's no such thing as joy!

  --_Harold Susman_.


A pessimist is one who, of two evils, chooses them both.


"I had a mighty queer surprise this morning," remarked a local stock
broker. "I put on my last summer's thin suit on account of this
extraordinary hot weather, and in one of the trousers pockets I found a
big roll of bills which I had entirely forgotten."

"Were any of them receipted?" asked a pessimist.


To tell men that they cannot help themselves is to fling them into
recklessness and despair.--_Fronde_.


  With earth's first clay they did the last man knead,
  And there of the last harvest sowed the seed:
  And the first morning of creation wrote
  What the last dawn of reckoning shall read.

  Yesterday this day's madness did prepare;
  Tomorrow's silence, triumph, or despair.
  Drink! For you know not whence you came, nor why;
  Drink! For you know not why you go, nor where.

  --_Omar Khayyam_
