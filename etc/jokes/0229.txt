ENEMIES


An old man who had led a sinful life was dying, and his wife sent for a
near-by preacher to pray with him.

The preacher spent some time praying and talking, and finally the old
man said: "What do you want me to do, Parson?"

"Renounce the Devil, renounce the Devil," replied the preacher.

"Well, but, Parson," protested the dying man, "I ain't in position to
make any enemies."


It is better to decide a difference between enemies than friends, for
one of our friends will certainly become an enemy and one of our enemies
a friend.--_Bias_.


  The world is large when its weary leagues
    two loving hearts divide;
  But the world is small when your enemy is
    loose on the other side.

  --_John Boyle O'Reilly_.
