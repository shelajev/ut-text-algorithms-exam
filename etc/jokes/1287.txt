A FRIEND IN NEED

What true friendship consists in depends on the temperament of the man
who has a friend. It is related that at the funeral of Mr. Scroggs, who
died extremely poor, the usually cold-blooded Squire Tightfist was much
affected.

"You thought a great deal of him, I suppose?" some one asked him.

"Thought a great deal of him? I should think I did. There was a true
friend. He never asked me to lend him a cent, though I knew well enough
he was starving to death."
