BRIDES


"My dear," said the young husband as he took the bottle of milk from the
dumb-waiter and held it up to the light, "have you noticed that there's
never cream on this milk?"

"I spoke to the milkman about it," she replied, "and he explained that
the company always fill their bottles so full that there's no room for
cream on top."


"Do you think only of me?" murmured the bride. "Tell me that you think
only of me."

"It's this way," explained the groom gently. "Now and then I have to
think of the furnace, my dear."
