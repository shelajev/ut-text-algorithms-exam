THIN PEOPLE


  There was an old fellow named Green,
  Who grew so abnormally lean,
    And flat, and compressed,
    That his back touched his chest,
  And sideways he couldn't be seen.

  There was a young lady of Lynn,
  Who was so excessively thin,
    That when she essayed
    To drink lemonade
  She slipped through the straw and fell in.
