FATE


  Fate hit me very hard one day.
  I cried: "What is my fault?
  What have I done? What causes, pray,
  This unprovoked assault?"
  She paused, then said: "Darned if I know;
  I really can't explain."
  Then just before she turned to go
  She whacked me once again!

  --_La Touche Hancock_.


  So in the Libyan fable it is told
  That once an eagle stricken with a dart,
  Said, when he saw the fashion of the shaft,
  "With our own feathers, not by others' hands,
  Are we now smitten."

  --_Aeschylus_.
