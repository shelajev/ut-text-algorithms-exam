SAVING


Take care of the pennies and the dollars will be blown in by your
heirs.--_Puck_.


"Do you save up money for a rainy day, dear?"

"Oh, no! I never shop when it rains."


JOHNNY--"Papa, would you be glad if I saved a dollar for you?"

PAPA--"Certainly, my son."

JOHNNY--"Well, I saved it for you, all right. You said if I brought a
first-class report from my teacher this week you would give me a dollar,
and I didn't bring it."


According to the following story, economy has its pains as well as its
pleasures, even after the saving is done.

One spring, for some reason, old Eli was going round town with the face
of dissatisfaction, and, when questioned, poured forth his voluble tale
of woe thus:

"Marse Geo'ge, he come to me last fall an' he say, 'Eli, dis gwine ter
be a hard winter, so yo' be keerful, an' save yo' wages fas' an' tight.'

"An' I b'lieve Marse Geo'ge, yas, sah, I b'lieve him, an' I save an' I
save, an' when de winter come it ain't got no hardship, an' dere was I
wid all dat money jes' frown on mah hands!"


"Robert dear," said the coy little maiden to her sweetheart, "I'm sure
you love me; but give me some proof of it, darling. We can't marry on
fifteen dollars a week, you know."

"Well, what do you want me to do?" said he, with a grieved air.

"Why, save up a thousand dollars, and have it safe in the bank, and then
I'll marry you."

About two months later she cuddled up close to him on the sofa one
evening, and said:

"Robert dear, have you saved up that thousand yet?"

"Why, no, my love," he replied; "not all of it."

"How much have you saved, darling?"

"Just two dollars and thirty-five cents, dear."

"Oh, well," said the sweet young thing as she snuggled a little closer,
"don't let's wait any longer, darling. I guess that'll do."--_R.M.
Winans_.
