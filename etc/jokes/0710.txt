Sometimes the use of a diplomatic method defeats its own purpose, as in
the case of the old fellow who was enthusiastic in praise of the busy
lawyer from whose office he had just come, after a purely social call.

pleasantest chaps I ever did meet. Why, I dropped in on him jest to pass
the time o' day this mornin', an' I hadn't been chattin' with 'im more'n
five minutes before he'd told me three times to come and see 'im agin."
