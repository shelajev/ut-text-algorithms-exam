A BAD NIGHT

The boy who had "made good" in town asked his old mother to come to
London. He gave the old lady the best room in the hotel--one with a
private bath adjoining. The next morning the boy asked:

"Did you have a good night's rest?"

"Well, no, I didn't," she replied. "The room was all right, and the bed
was pretty. But I couldn't sleep very much, for I was afraid someone
would want to take a bath, and the only way to it was through my room!"
