SPRING


  In the spring the housemaid's fancy
    Lightly turns from pot and pan
  To the greater necromancy
    Of a young unmarried man.
  You can hold her through the winter,
    And she'll work around and sing,
  But it's just as good as certain
    She will marry in the spring.


  It is easy enough to look pleasant,
  When the spring comes along with a rush;
    But the fellow worth-while
    Is the one who can smile
  When he slips and sits down in the slush.

  --_Leslie Van Every_.
