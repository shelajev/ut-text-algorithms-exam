SHOES MISUSED.


A LADY bespoke a pair of dress shoes from an eminent shoemaker in
Jermyn-street. When they were brought home she was delighted with them.
She put them on the same evening, and went to a ball, where she danced.
Next day, examining her favorite shoes, she found them almost in pieces.
She sent for the tradesman, and showed him them. "Good God!" said he,
"it is not possible." At length, recollecting himself, he added, "How
stupid I am! as sure as death your ladyship must have _walked in them_."
