SENSE OF HUMOR


  "What of his sense of humor?"
  "Well, he has to see a joke twice before he sees it once."

  --_Richard Kirk_.


"A sense of humor is a help and a blessing through life," says Rear
Admiral Buhler. "But even a sense of humor may exist in excess. I have
in mind the case of a British soldier who was sentenced to be flogged.
During the flogging he laughed continually. The harder the lash was laid
on, the harder the soldier laughed.

"'Wot's so funny about bein' flogged?' demanded the sergeant.

"'Why,' the soldier chuckled, 'I'm the wrong man.'"


Mark Twain once approached a friend, a business man, and confided to him
that he needed the assistance of a stenographer.

"I can send you one, a fine young fellow," the friend said, "He came to
my office yesterday in search of a position, but I didn't have an
opening."

"Has he a sense of humor?" Mark asked cautiously.

"A sense of humor? He has--in fact, he got off one or two pretty witty
things himself yesterday," the friend hastened to assure him.

"Sorry, but he won't do, then," Mark said.

"Won't do? Why?"

"No," said Mark. "I had one once before with a sense of humor, and it
interfered too much with the work. I cannot afford to pay a man two
dollars a day for laughing."


The perception of the ludicrous is a pledge of sanity.--_Emerson_.
