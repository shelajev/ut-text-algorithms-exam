HUNTING


A gentleman from London was invited to go for "a day's snipe-shooting"
in the country. The invitation was accepted, and host and guest
shouldered guns and sallied forth in quest of game.

After a time a solitary snipe rose, and promptly fell to the visitor's
first barrell.

The host's face fell also.

"We may as well return," he remarked, gloomily, "for that was the only
snipe in the neighborhood."

The bird had afforded excellent sport to all his friends for six weeks.
