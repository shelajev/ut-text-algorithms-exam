VOICE


A lanky country youth entered the crossroads general store to order some
groceries. He was seventeen years old and was passing through that stage
of adolescence during which a boy seems all hands and feet, and his
vocal organs, rapidly developing, are wont to cause his voice to undergo
sudden and involuntary changes from high treble to low bass.

In an authoritative rumbling bass voice he demanded of the busy clerk,
"Give me a can of corn" (then, his voice suddenly changing to a shrill
falsetto, he continued) "and a sack of flour."

"Well, don't be in a hurry. I can't wait on both of you at once,"
snapped the clerk.


ASPIRING VOCALIST--"Professor, do you think I will ever be able to do
anything with my voice?"

PERSPIRING TEACHER--"Well it might come in handy in case of fire or
shipwreck."--_Cornell Widow_.


  The devil hath not, in all his quiver's choice,
  An arrow for the heart like a sweet voice.

  --_Byron_.
