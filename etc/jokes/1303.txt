The newly-elected president of a banking institution was being
introduced to the employees. He singled out one of the men in the
cashier's cage, questioning him in detail about his work, etc. "I have
been here forty years," said the cashier's assistant, with conscious
pride, "and in all that time I only made one slight mistake."

"Good," replied the president. "Let me congratulate you. But hereafter
be more careful."
