FOUNTAIN PENS


"Fust time you've ever milked a cow, is it?" said Uncle Josh to his
visiting nephew. "Wal, y' do it a durn sight better'n most city fellers
do."

"It seems to come natural somehow," said the youth, flushing with
pleasure. "I've had a good deal of practice with a fountain pen."


"Percy" asks if we know anything which will change the color of the
fingers when they have become yellow from cigarette smoking.

He might try using one of the inferior makes of fountain pens.
