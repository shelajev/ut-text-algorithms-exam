HE KNEW

Mr. and Mrs. Smith had been invited to a friend's for tea, and the time
had arrived for preparing for the visit. "Come along, dearie," said Mr.
Smith to her three-year-old son, "and have your face washed."

"Don't want to be washed," came the reply.

"But," said mother, "you don't want to be a dirty boy, do you? I want my
little boy to have a nice, clean face for the ladies to kiss."

Upon this persuasion he gave way, and was washed. A few minutes later he
stood watching his father washing. "Ha, ha, daddy!" he cried, "I know
why you're washing!"
