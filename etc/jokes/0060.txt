BEAUTY


  If eyes were made for seeing,
  Then beauty is its own excuse for being.

  --Emerson.


  A thing of beauty is a joy forever;
  Its loveliness increases; it will never
  Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
  A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
  Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.
