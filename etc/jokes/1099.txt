REMEMBERED

Blinks, after inviting his friend, Jinks, who has just returned from
abroad, to dinner, is telling him what a fine memory his little son
Bobby has.

"And do you suppose he will remember me?" said Jinks.

"Remember you? Why, he remembers every face that he ever saw."

An hour later they entered the house, and after Jinks had shaken hands
with Mrs. Blinks, he calls Bobby over to him.

"And do you remember me, my little man?"

"Course I do. You're the same man that pa brought home last summer, and
ma was so wild about it that she didn't speak to pa for a whole week."
