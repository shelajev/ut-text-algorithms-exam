ADVICE


Her exalted rank did not give Queen Victoria immunity from the trials of
a grandmother. One of her grandsons, whose recklessness in spending
money provoked her strong disapproval, wrote to the Queen reminding her
of his approaching birthday and delicately suggesting that money would
be the most acceptable gift. In her own hand she answered, sternly
reproving the youth for the sin of extravagance and urging upon him the
practise of economy. His reply staggered her:

"Dear Grandma," it ran, "thank you for your kind letter of advice. I
have sold the same for five pounds."


Many receive advice, only the wise profit by it.--_Publius Syrus_.
