The teacher asked the little girl if she was going to the Maypole dance.
"No, I ain't going," was the reply.

The teacher corrected the child:

"You must not say, 'I ain't going,' you must say, 'I am not going.'"
And she added to impress the point: "I am not going. He is not going. We
are not going. You are not going. They are not going. Now, dear, can you
say all that?"

The little girl nodded and smiled brightly.

"Sure!" she replied. "They ain't nobody going."
