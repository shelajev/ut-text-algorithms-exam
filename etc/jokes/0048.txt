BACTERIA


  There once were some learned M.D.'s,
  Who captured some germs of disease,
    And infected a train
    Which, without causing pain,
  Allowed one to catch it with ease.


Two doctors met in the hall of the hospital.

"Well," said the first, "what's new this morning?"

"I've got a most curious case. Woman, cross-eyed; in fact, so cross-eyed
that when she cries the tears run down her back."

"What are you doing for her?"

"Just now," was the answer, "we're treating her for bacteria."
