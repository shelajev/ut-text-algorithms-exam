CHRISTIAN SCIENTISTS


While waiting for the speaker at a public meeting a pale little man in
the audience seemed very nervous. He glanced over his shoulder from time
to time and squirmed and shifted about in his seat. At last, unable to
stand it longer, he arose and demanded, in a high, penetrating voice,
"Is there a Christian Scientist in this room?"

A woman at the other side of the hall got up and said, "I am a Christian
Scientist."

"Well, then, madam," requested the little man, "would you mind changing
seats with me? I'm sitting in a draft."
