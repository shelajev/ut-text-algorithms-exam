The young lady interested in botany inquired of the gentleman who had
been traveling in the South.

"What sort of a plant is the Virginia creeper?"

"That is not a plant," was the answer, given wearily; "it's a railroad."


SPELLING

Some time before Mr. Taft became President of the United States, he took
an extended trip in the mountains of West Virginia. On one occasion, he
was conveyed along the mountain roads in a buggy driven by a native of
the region. As they came to a small stream, Mr. Taft, without any
particular interest, inquired concerning the brook's name. So far as he
could understand, the answer was:

"This here are Swum-swum Crick."

"What?" Mr. Taft demanded.

In the repetition, the words sounded like:

"This here are Swoovel Crick."

The questioner was so puzzled that he asked the mountaineer how the name
of the Creek was spelled.

The native spat tobacco juice reflectively over the wheel, and then
spoke judicially:

"Waal, some spells it one way, an' some spells it another way; but in my
jedgmint thar are no propeer way."
