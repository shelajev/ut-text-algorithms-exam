A bright little newsie entered a business office and, approaching a
glum-looking man at one of the desks, began with an ingratiating smile:
"I'm selling thimbles to raise enough money to----"

"Out with you," interrupted the man.

"Wouldn't you like to look at some nice thimbles?"

"I should say not!"

"They're fine, and I'd like to make a sale," the boy continued.

Turning in his chair to fully face the lad, the grouch caustically
inquired: "What 'n seven kinds of blue blazes do you think I want with a
thimble?"

Edging toward the door to make a safe getaway, the boy answered: "Use it
for a hat."
