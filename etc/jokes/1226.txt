REALITY

A man, who is the father of a year-old youngster, met his pastor on
Sunday afternoon.

"Why weren't you at church this morning?" was the first question of the
spiritual adviser.

"I couldn't come," was the answer. "I had to stop at home and mind the
baby; our nurse is ill."

"That's no excuse," said the pastor.

"It isn't? Well, next Sunday I'll bring him to church with me and see
how you like it."
