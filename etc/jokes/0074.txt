BONANZAS


A certain Congressman had disastrous experience in goldmine
speculations. One day a number of colleagues were discussing
the subject of his speculation, when one of them said
to this Western member:

"Old chap, as an expert, give us a definition of the term,
'bonanza.'"

"A 'bonanza,'" replied the Western man with emphasis, "is
a hole in the ground owned by a champion liar!"
