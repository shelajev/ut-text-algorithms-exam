TARDINESS


"You'll be late for supper, sonny," said the merchant, in passing a
small boy who was carrying a package.

"No, I won't," was the reply. "I've dot de meat."--_Mabel Long_.


"How does it happen that you are five minutes late at school this
morning?" the teacher asked severely.

"Please, ma'am," said Ethel, "I must have overwashed myself."
