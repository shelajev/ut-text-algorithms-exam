HOME


Home is a place where you can take off your new shoes and put on your
old manners.


  Who hath not met with home-made bread,
  A heavy compound of putty and lead--
  And home-made wines that rack the head,
  And home-made liquors and waters?
  Home-made pop that will not foam,
  And home-made dishes that drive one from home--
             * * * * * *
  Home-made by the homely daughters.

  --_Hood_.
