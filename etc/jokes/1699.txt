THE REVERSE.


THE Abbé Tegnier, secretary to the French academy, one day made a
collection of a pistole a head from the members, for some general
expense. Not observing that the President Rose, who was very penurious,
had put his money in the hat, he presented it to him a second time. M.
Rose assured him that he had put in his pistole. "I believe it," said
the Abbé, "though I did not see it." "And I," said Fontenelle, "saw it,
and could not believe it."
