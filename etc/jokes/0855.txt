The man about to take a train was worried by the station clocks. There
was twenty minutes difference between the one in the office and the one
in the waiting-room. Finally, he questioned a porter. That worthy made a
careful survey of the two clocks, and shook his head doubtfully. Then,
he brightened suddenly, and said:

"It don't make a single mite of difference about the clocks. The train
goes at four-ten, no matter what."


SEASICKNESS

On the first morning of the voyage, the vessel ran into a nasty choppy
sea, which steadily grew worse. There were twenty-five passengers at the
captain's table for dinner, and he addressed them in an amiable
welcoming speech:

"I hope that all twenty-five of you will have a pleasant trip." The soup
appeared, and he continued: "I sincerely hope that this little assembly
of twenty-four will thoroughly enjoy the voyage. I look upon these
twenty-two smiling faces as a father upon his family, for I am
responsible for the safety of this group of seventeen. And now I ask
that all fourteen of you join me in drinking to a merry trip. Indeed, I
believe that we eight are most congenial, and I applaud the good fortune
that brought these three persons to my table. You and I, my dear sir,
are---- Here, steward, clear away all those dishes, and bring me the
fish."
