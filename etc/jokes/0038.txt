ARTISTS


ARTIST--"I'd like to devote my last picture to a charitable purpose."

CRITIC--"Why not give it to an institution for the blind?"


"Wealth has its penalties." said the ready-made philosopher.

"Yes," replied Mr. Cumrox. "I'd rather be back at the dear old factory
than learning to pronounce the names of the old masters in my
picture-gallery."


CRITIC--"By George, old chap, when I look at one of your paintings I
stand and wonder--"

ARTIST--"How I do it?"

CRITIC "No; why you do it."


He that seeks popularity in art closes the door on his own genius: as he
must needs paint for other minds, and not for his own.--_Mrs. Jameson_.
