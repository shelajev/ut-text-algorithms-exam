HALF A DUCK DEEP

Coming to a river with which he was unfamiliar, a traveller asked a
youngster if it was deep.

"No," replied the boy, and the rider started to cross, but soon found
that he and his horse had to swim for their lives.

When the traveller reached the other side he turned and shouted: "I
thought you said it wasn't deep?"

"It isn't," was the reply; "it only takes grandfather's ducks up to
their middles!"
