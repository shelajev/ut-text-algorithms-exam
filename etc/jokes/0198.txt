DIET


Eat, drink, and be merry, for to-morrow ye diet.--_William Gilmore
Beymer_.


  There was a young lady named Perkins,
  Who had a great fondness for gherkins;
    She went to a tea
    And ate twenty-three,
  Which pickled her internal workin's.


"Mother," asked the little one, on the occasion of a number of guests
being present at dinner, "will the dessert hurt me, or is there enough
to go round?"


The doctor told him he needed carbohydrates, proteids, and above all,
something nitrogenous. The doctor mentioned a long list of foods for him
to eat. He staggered out and wabbled into a Penn avenue restaurant.

"How about beefsteak?" he asked the waiter. "Is that nitrogenous?"

The waiter didn't know.

"Are fried potatoes rich in carbohydrates or not?"

The waiter couldn't say.

"Well, I'll fix it," declared the poor man in despair. "Bring me a large
plate of hash."


   A Colonel, who used to assert
   That naught his digestion could hurt,
     Was forced to admit
     That his weak point was hit
   When they gave him hot shot for dessert.


To abstain that we may enjoy is the epicurianism of reason.--_Rousseau_.


They are as sick that surfeit with too much, as they that starve with
nothing.--_Shakespeare_.
