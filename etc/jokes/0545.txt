REVOLUTIONS


Haiti was in the midst of a revolution.

As a phase of it two armed bodies were approaching each other so that a
third was about to be caught between them.

The commander of the third party saw the predicament. On the right
government troops, on the left insurgents.

"General, why do you not give the order to fire?" asked an aide, dashing
up on a lame mule.

"I would like to," responded the general, "but, Great Scott! I can't
remember which side we're fighting for."
