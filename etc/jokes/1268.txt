TOO SMART

A Chinaman entered a jeweller's in Liverpool and asked to be shown some
"welly good watches." The proprietor, a Jew, being absent, the
prospective customer was attended to by his daughter, who got out three
watches, marked respectively _£_5, _£_4, and _£_3 10_s._, and laid them
in a row on the counter.

The Chink, after looking very closely at them, called the attention of
the Jewess to a watch on a shelf behind her; as she turned to obtain the
watch he placed the higher-priced watch, in the place of the
lower-priced one, and, not caring for the watch now shown him, said: "Me
no likee that; I takee cheapee watch," paid _£_3 10_s._, and departed.

Soon the girl discovered the deception, and told her father on his
return.

"Never mind, my tear," said he, with a smile; "dose vatches cost all de
same brice--two pound; but vat a scoundrel dat Chinaman must be!"
