BRIBERY


A judge, disgusted with a jury that seemed unable to reach an agreement
in a perfectly evident case, rose and said, "I discharge this jury."

One sensitive talesman, indignant at what he considered a rebuke,
obstinately faced the judge.

"You can't discharge me," he said in tones of one standing upon his
rights.

"And why not?" asked the surprised judge.

"Because," announced the juror, pointing to the lawyer for the defense,
"I'm being hired by that man there!"
