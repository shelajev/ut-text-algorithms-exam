OCEAN


A resident of Nahant tells this one on a new servant his wife took down
from Boston.

"Did you sleep well, Mary?" the girl was asked the following morning.

"Sure, I did not, ma'am," was the reply; "the snorin' of the ocean kept
me awake all night."


Love the sea? I dote upon it--from the beach.--_Douglas Jerrold_.


  I never was on the dull, tame shore,
  But I loved the great sea more and more.

  --_Barry Cornwall_.
