LOVE


Love is an insane desire on the part of a chump to pay a woman's
board-bill for life.


MR. SLIMPURSE--"But why do you insist that our daughter should marry a
man whom she does not like? You married for love, didn't you?"

MRS. SLIMPURSE--"Yes; but that is no reason why I should let our
daughter make the same blunder."


MAUDE--"Jack is telling around that you are worth your weight in gold."

ETHEL--"The foolish boy. Who is he telling it to?"

MAUDE--"His creditors."


RICH MAN--"Would you love my daughter just as much if she had no money?"

SUITOR--"Why, certainly!"

RICH MAN--"That's sufficient. I don't want any idiots in this family."


  'Tis better to have lived and loved
  Than never to have lived at all.

  --_Judge_.


May we have those in our arms that we love in our hearts.


Here's to love, the only fire against which there is no insurance.


  Here's to those that I love;
  Here's to those who love me;
  Here's to those who love those that I love.
  Here's to those who love those who love me.


It is best to love wisely, no doubt; but to love foolishly is better
than not to be able to love at all.--_Thackeray_.


  Mysterious love, uncertain treasure,
  Hast thou more of pain or pleasure!
  *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *
  Endless torments dwell about thee:
  Yet who would live, and live without thee!

  --_Addison_.


    O, love, love, love!
    Love is like a dizziness;
  It winna let a poor body
      Gang about his biziness!

  --_Hogg_.


Let the man who does not wish to be idle, fall in love.--_Ovid_.
