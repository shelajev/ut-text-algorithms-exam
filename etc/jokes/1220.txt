There had been a collision near Euston Station between a timber-cart and
a cab.

The cart-driver said, with mock sympathy: "Oh, well, you can't help it!
You're doin' yer bit, you an' yer 'orse and yer blankety cabs all over
age!"

"You're doin' yer bit, too, ain't yer?" was the cabby's rejoinder,
"a'carrying of two lots o' wood--one in yer cart an' the other under yer
blinkin' 'at!"
