FISH


A man went into a restaurant recently and said, "Give me a half dozen
fried oysters."

"Sorry, sah," answered the waiter, "but we's all out o' shell fish, sah,
'ceptin' eggs."


Little Elizabeth and her mother were having luncheon together, and the
mother, who always tried to impress facts upon her young daughter, said:

"These little sardines, Elizabeth, are sometimes eaten by the larger
fish."

Elizabeth gazed at the sardines in wonder, and then asked:

"But, mother, how do the large fish get the cans open?"
