GIFTS


When Lawrence Barrett's daughter was married Stuart Robson sent a check
for $5000 to the bridegroom. The comedian's daughter, Felicia Robson,
who attended the wedding conveyed the gift.

"Felicia," said her father upon her return, "did you give him the
check?"

"Yes, Father," answered the daughter.

"What did he say?" asked Robson.

"He didn't say anything," replied Miss Felicia, "but he shed tears."

"How long did he cry?"

"Why Father, I didn't time him. I should say, however, that he wept
fully a minute."

"Fully a minute," mused Robson. "Why, Daughter, I cried an hour after I
signed it."


A church house in a certain rural district was sadly in need of repairs.
The official board had called a meeting of the parishioners to see what
could be done toward raising the necessary funds. One of the wealthiest
and stingiest of the adherents of that church arose and said that he
would give five dollars, and sat down.

Just then a bit of plastering fell from the ceiling and hit him squarely
upon the head. Whereupon he jumped up, looked confused and said:
"I--er--I meant I'll give fifty dollars!" then again resumed his seat.

After a brief silence a voice was heard to say: "O Lord, hit 'im again!"


He gives twice who gives quickly because the collectors come around
later on and hit him for another subscription.--_Puck_.


"Presents," I often say, "endear Absents."--_Charles Lamb_.


In giving, a man receives more than he gives, and the more is in
proportion to the worth of the thing given.--_George MacDonald_.
