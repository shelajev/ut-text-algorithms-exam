If you favor war, dig a trench in your backyard, fill it half full of
water, crawl into it, and stay there for a day or two without anything
to eat, get a lunatic to shoot at you with a brace of revolvers and a
machine gun, and you will have something just as good, and you will save
your country a great deal of expense.


"Who are those people who are cheering?" asked the recruit as the
soldiers marched to the train.

"Those," replied the veteran, "are the people who are not

  He who did well in war, just earns the right
  To begin doing well in peace.

  --_Robert Browning_.


A great and lasting war can never be supported on this principle
[patriotism] alone. It must be aided by a prospect of interest, or some
reward.--_George Washington_.
