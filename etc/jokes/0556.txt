SCHOLARSHIP


There is in Washington an old "grouch' whose son was graduated from
Yale. When the young man came home at the end of his first term, he
exulted in the fact that he stood next to the head of his class. But the
old gentleman was not satisfied.

"_Next_ to the head!" he exclaimed. "What do you mean? I'd like to know
what you think I'm sending you to college for? _Next_ to the head! Why
aren't you at the head, where you ought to be?"

At this the son was much crestfallen; but upon his return, he went about
his work with such ambition that at the end of the term he found himself
in the coveted place. When he went home that year he felt very proud. It
would be great news for the old man.

When the announcement was made, the father contemplated his son for a
few minutes in silence; then, with a shrug, he remarked:

"At the head of the class, eh? Well, that's a fine commentary on Yale
University!"--_Howard Morse_.


"Well, there were only three boys in school to-day who could answer one
question that the teacher asked us," said a proud boy of eight.

"And I hope my boy was one of the three," said the proud mother.

"Well, I was," answered Young Hopeful, "and Sam Harris and Harry Stone
were the other two."

"I am very glad you proved yourself so good a scholar, my son; it makes
your mother proud of you. What question did the teacher ask, Johnnie?"

"'Who broke the glass in the back window?'"


Sammy's mother was greatly distressed because he had such poor marks in
his school work. She scolded, coaxed, even promised him a dime if he
would do better. The next day he came running home.

"Oh, mother," he shouted, "I got a hundred!"

"And what did you get a hundred in?"

"In two things," replied Sammy without hesitation. "I got forty in
readin' and sixty in spellin'."
