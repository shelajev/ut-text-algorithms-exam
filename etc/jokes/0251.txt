FAME


Fame is the feeling that you are the constant subject of admiration on
the part of people who are not thinking of you.


Many a man thinks he has become famous when he has merely happened to
meet an editor who was hard up for material.


Were not this desire of fame very strong, the difficulty of obtaining
it, and the danger of losing it when obtained, would be sufficient to
deter a man from so vain a pursuit.--_Addison_.
