OFF LIKE A SHOT

It was a case of attempted murder, in which the prisoner was accused of
having fired twice at his intended victim. One of the witnesses for the
prosecution was being severely cross-examined by the defending counsel.

"You say that you heard both shots fired?" he asked sternly.

"Yes, sir."

"How near were you to the scene of the affair?"

"At the time the first shot was fired I was about twenty feet from the
prisoner."

"Twenty feet. Humph! Now tell the court how far you were off when you
heard the second shot."

"Well, sir," replied the witness slowly, "I didn't exactly measure the
distance; but, speaking approximately, I should say about half a mile."
