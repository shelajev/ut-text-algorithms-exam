GLUTTONY


A clergyman was quite ill as a result of eating many pieces of mince
pie.

A brother minister visited him and asked him if he was afraid to die.

"No," the sick man replied, "But I should be ashamed to die from eating
too much."


There was a young person named Ned,
Who dined before going to bed,
  On lobster and ham
  And salad and jam,
And when he awoke he was dead.
