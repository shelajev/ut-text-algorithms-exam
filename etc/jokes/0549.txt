ROASTS


As William Faversham was having his luncheon in a Birmingham hotel he
was much annoyed by another visitor, who, during the whole of the meal,
stood with his back to the fire warming himself and watching Faversham
eat. At length, unable to endure it any longer, Mr. Faversham rang the
bell and said:

"Waiter, kindly turn that gentleman around. I think he is done on that
side."
