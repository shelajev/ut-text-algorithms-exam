Two men met on the city street in the evening, and had a number of
drinks together. The one who lived in the suburbs became confidential,
and exhibited a string tied around a finger.

"I don't dare to go home," he explained. "There's something my wife told
me to do, without fail, and to make sure I wouldn't forget, she tied
that string around my finger. But for the life of me I can't remember
what the thing was I am to do. And I don't dare to go home!"

A few days later the two men met again, this time in the afternoon.

"Well," the one asked, "did you finally remember what that string was to
remind you of?"

The other showed great gloom in his expression, as he replied:

"I didn't go home until the next night, just because I was scared, and
then my wife told me what the string was for all right--she certainly
did!" There was a note of pain in his voice. "The string was to remind
me to be sure to come home early."
