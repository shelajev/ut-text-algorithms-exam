IN ORDER TO BE FILLED

Two negroes were working in a coal-bin in a Mississippi town, one down
in the bin throwing out the coal and the other wielding a shovel. The
one inside picked up a large lump and heaving it carelessly into the
air, struck the other a resounding blow on the head.

As soon as the victim had recovered from his momentary daze he walked
over to the edge of the bin and, peering down at his mate, said:

"Nigger, how come you don't watch where you throws dat coal? You done
hit me smack on de haid."

The other one looked surprised.

"Did I hit you?"

"You sho' did," came the answer. "And I jes' wants to tell you, I've
been promising the debil a man a long time, and you certainly does
resemble my promise."
