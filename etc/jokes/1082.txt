A GREAT ATHLETE

Micky Bryan and Patsy Kelly had been schoolmates together, but they had
drifted apart in after life. They met one day, and the conversation
turned on athletics.

"Did ye ivir meet my bruther Dennis?" asked Pat. "He has just won a gold
medal in a foot race."

"Bedad," replied Mike. "Sure, an' thot's foine. But did I ivir tell ye
about my uncle at Ballycluna?"

"I don't remember," replied Pat.

"Well," said Mike, "he's got a gold medal for five miles, an' one for
ten miles, two sets of carvers for cycling, a silver medal for swimming,
two cups for wrestling, an' badges for boxing an' rowing!"

"Begorra," said Pat, "he must have bin a wonderful athlete, indade!"

"Shure, an' he's no athlete at all--at all," came the reply. "He kapes
the pawnshop!"
