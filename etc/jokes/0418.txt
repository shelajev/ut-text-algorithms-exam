HE--"Yes, my dear child; but he gave them their first taste in

people that inhabited a far-away land. Some insisted that they were not

However, the question was finally decided by a minister's widow, who
said:

"I beg pardon for interrupting, Mrs. Chairman, but I can assure you that
they are cannibals. My husband was a missionary there and they ate him."
