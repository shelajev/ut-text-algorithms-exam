RETORT COURTEOUS.


SOON after Whitefield landed in Boston, on his second visit to this
country, he and Dr. Chauncey met in the street, and, touching their hats
with courteous dignity, bowed to each other. "So you have returned, Mr.
Whitefield, have you?" He replied, "Yes, Reverend Sir, in the service of
the Lord." "I am sorry to hear it," said Chauncey. "So is the Devil!"
was the answer given, as the two divines, stepping aside at a distance
from each other, touched their hats and passed on.
