The teacher put a question to the class:

"What does a cat have that no other animal has?"

A number cried in unison:

"Fur!"

But an objector raised the point that bears and skunks have fur. One
pupil raised an eager hand:

"I know, teacher--whiskers!"

But another objector laughed scornfully.

"Haw-haw! My papa has whiskers!"

The suggester of whiskers defended her idea by declaring: "My papa ain't
got whiskers."

"'Cause he can't!" the objector sneered. "Haw-haw! Your pa ain't no
good. My pa says----"

The teacher rapped for order, and repeated her question. A little girl
raised her hand, and at the teacher's nod spoke timidly.

"Kittens!"
