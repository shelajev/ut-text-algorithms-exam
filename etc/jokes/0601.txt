SUICIDE


The Chinese Consul at San Francisco, at a recent dinner, discussed his
country's customs.

"There is one custom," said a young girl, "that I can't understand--and
that is the Chinese custom of committing suicide by eating gold-leaf. I
can't understand how gold-leaf can kill."

"The partaker, no doubt," smiled the Consul, "succumbs from a
consciousness of inward gilt."
