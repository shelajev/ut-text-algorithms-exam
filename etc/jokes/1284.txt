A NATURAL PICTURE

A man and his eldest son went to have their photographs taken together,
and the photographer said to the young man, "It will make a better
picture if you put your hand on your father's shoulder."

"H'm," said the father, "it would make a more natural picture if he put
it in my pocket."
