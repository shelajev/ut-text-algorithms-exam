Once, in a rush season, an office boy was kept working overtime for
several nights. He didn't like it, and growled to his boss: "You've kept
me workin' every night till 9 o'clock for three nights runnin' now, and
I'm worn out, Mr. Brown. I ain't no machine. I can't go forever." His
boss gave a hard laugh. "Wrong!" he said. "Wrong, my boy. You go forever
next pay day."
