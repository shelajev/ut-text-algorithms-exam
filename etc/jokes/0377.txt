LANDLORDS


An English tourist was sightseeing in Ireland and the guide had pointed
out the Devil's Gap, the Devil's Peak, and the Devil's Leap to him.

"Pat," he said, "the devil seems to have a great deal of property in
this district!"

"He has, sir," replied the guide, "but, sure, he's like all the
landlords--he lives in England!"
