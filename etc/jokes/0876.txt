The following extract is from the diary of a New England woman who lived
in the eighteenth century:

"We had roast pork for dinner and the Doctor, who carved, held up a rib
on his fork, and said: 'Here, ladies, is what Mother Eve was made of.'"

"'Yes,' said sister Patty, 'and it is from very much the same kind of
critter'."
