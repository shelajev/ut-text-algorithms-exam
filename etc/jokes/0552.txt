SALOONS


"Where can I get a drink in this town?" asked a traveling man who landed
at a little town in the oil region of Oklahoma, of the 'bus driver.

"See that millinery shop over there?" asked the driver, pointing to a
building near the depot.

"You don't mean to say they sell whiskey in a millinery store?"
exclaimed the drummer.

"No, I mean that's the only place here they don't sell it," said the
'bus man.
