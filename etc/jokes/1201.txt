A negro was brought before a justice of the peace. He was suspected of
stealing. There were no witnesses, but appearances were against him. The
following dialogue took place:

"You've stolen no chickens?"

"No, sah."

"Have you stolen any geese?"

"No, sah."

"Any turkeys?"

"No, sah."

The man was discharged. As he stepped out of the dock he stopped before
the justice and said with a broad grin, "Fo' de Lawd, squire, if you'd
said ducks you'd 'a' had me."
