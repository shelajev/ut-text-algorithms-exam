LUCK


Some people are so fond of ill-luck that they run half-way to meet
it.--_Douglas Jerrold_.


  O, once in each man's life, at least,
    Good luck knocks at his door;
  And wit to seize the flitting guest
    Need never hunger more.
  But while the loitering idler waits
    Good luck beside his fire,
  The bold heart storms at fortunes gates,
    And conquers its desire.

  --_Lewis J. Bates_.


"Tommy," said his brother, "you're a regular little glutton. How can you
eat so much?"

"Don't know; it's just good luck," replied the youngster.


A negro who was having one misfortune after another said he was having
as bad luck as the man with only a fork when it was raining soup.
