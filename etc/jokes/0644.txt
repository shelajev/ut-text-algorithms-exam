TRUSTS


A trust is known by the companies it keeps.--_Ellis O. Jones_.


TOMPKINS--"Ventley has received a million dollars for his patent egg
dating machine. You know it is absolutely interference-proof, and dates
correctly and indelibly as the egg is being laid."

DEWLEY--"Is the machine on the market yet?"

TOMKINS--"Oh, my no! and it won't be on the market. The patent was
bought by the Cold Storage Trust."
