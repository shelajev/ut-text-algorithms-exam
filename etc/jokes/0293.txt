GARDENING


Th' only time some fellers ever dig in th' gardens is just before they
go a fishin'.--_Abe Martin_.


"I am going to start a garden," announced Mr. Subbubs. "A few months
from now I won't be kicking about your prices."

"No," said the grocer; "you'll be wondering how I can afford to sell
vegetables so cheap."
