WIND


VISITOR--"What became of that other windmill that was here last year?"

NATIVE--"There was only enough wind for one, so we took it down."


  Whichever way the wind doth blow
  Some heart is glad to have it so;
  Then blow it east, or blow it west,
  The wind that blows, that wind is best.

  --_Caroline A. Mason_.
