MONEY


In some of the college settlements there are penny savings banks for
children.

One Saturday a small boy arrived with an important air and withdrew 2
cents from his account. Monday morning he promptly returned the money.

"So you didn't spend your 2 cents?" observed the worker in charge.

"Oh, no," he replied, "but a fellow just likes to have a little cash on
hand over Sunday."
