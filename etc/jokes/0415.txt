MILLIONAIRES


Recipe for a multi-millionaire:

  Take a boy with bare feet as a starter
   Add thrift and sobriety, mixed--
  Flavor with quarts of religion,
    And see that the tariff is fixed.

  --_Life_.


MILLIONAIRE (to a beggar)--"Be off with you this minute!"

BEGGAR--"Look 'ere, mister; the only difference between you and me is
that you are makin' your second million, while I am still workin' at my
first."


"Now that you have made $50,000,000, I suppose you are going to keep
right on for the purpose of trying to get a hundred millions?"

"No, sir. You do me an injustice. I'm going to put in the rest of my
time trying to get my conscience into a satisfactory condition."


"When I was a young man," said Mr. Cumrox, "I thought nothing of working
twelve or fourteen hours a day."

"Father," replied the young man with sporty clothes, "I wish you
wouldn't mention it. Those non-union sentiments are liable to make you
unpopular."


No good man ever became suddenly rich.--_Syrus_.


  And all to leave what with his toil he won,
  To that unfeather'd two-legged thing, a son.

  --_Dryden_.
