POETRY DONE TO ORDER.


ON one occasion a country gentleman, knowing Joseph Green's reputation
as a poet, procured an introduction to him, and solicited a "first-rate
epitaph" for a favorite servant who had lately died. Green asked what
were the man's chief qualities, and was told that "Cole excelled in all
things, but was particularly good at raking hay, which he could do
faster than anybody, the present company, of course, excepted." Green
wrote immediately--

    "Here lies the body of John Cole:
    His master loved him like his soul;
    He could rake hay; none could rake faster,
    Except that raking dog, his master."
