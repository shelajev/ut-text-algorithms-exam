MEN


  Here's to the men! God bless them!
    Worst of me sins, I confess them!
  In loving them all; be they great or small,
    So here's to the boys! God bless them!


    May all single men be married,
    And all married men be happy.


"What is your ideal man?"

"One who is clever enough to make money and foolish enough to spend it!"


I have thought some of Nature's journeymen had made men and not made
them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.--_Shakespeare_.


    Men are four:
  He who knows and knows not that he knows,--
    He is asleep--wake him;
  He who knows not and knows not that he knows not,--
    He is a fool--shun him;
  He who knows not and knows that he knows not,--
    He is a child--teach him;
  He who knows and knows that He knows,--
    He is a king--follow him.
