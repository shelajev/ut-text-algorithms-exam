HOMESTEADS


"Malachi," said a prospective homesteader to a lawyer, "you know all
about this law. Tell me what I am to do."

"Well," said the other, "I don't remember the exact wording of the law,
but I can give you the meaning of it. It's this: The government is
willin' to bet you one hundred and sixty acres of land against fourteen
dollars that you can't live on it five years without starving to
death."--_Fenimore Martin_.
