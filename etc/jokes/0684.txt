The man of the house finally took all the disabled umbrellas to the
repairer's. Next morning on his way to his office, when he got up to
leave the street car, he absentmindedly laid hold of the umbrella
belonging to a woman beside him, for he was in the habit of carrying
one. The woman cried "Stop thief!" rescued her umbrella and covered the
man with shame and confusion.

That same day, he stopped at the repairer's, and received all eight of
his umbrellas duly restored. As he entered a street car, with the
unwrapped umbrellas tucked under his arm, he was horrified to behold
glaring at him the lady of his morning adventure. Her voice came to him
charged with a withering scorn:

"Huh! Had a good day, didn't you!"
