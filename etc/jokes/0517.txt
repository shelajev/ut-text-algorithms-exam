RACE PREJUDICES


A negro preacher in a southern town was edified on one occasion by the
recital of a dream had by a member of the church.

"I was a-dreamin' all dis time," said the narrator, "dat I was in ole
Satan's dominions. I tell you, pahson, dat was shore a bad dream!"

"Was dere any white men dere?" asked the dusky divine.

"Shore dere was--plenty of 'em," the other hastened to assure his
minister "What was dey a-doin'?"

"Ebery one of 'em," was the answer, "was a-holdin' a cullud pusson
between him an' de fire!"
