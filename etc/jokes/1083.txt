NOTHING NEW TO HIM

The motor car was driven by a determined young woman, who had knocked
down a man without injuring him much.

She did not try to get away. Instead, she stopped the car, descended to
the solid earth and faced him manfully.

"I'm sorry it happened," she said grudgingly, "but it was all your
fault. You must have been walking carelessly. I'm an experienced driver.
I've been driving a car for seven years."

"Well," replied her victim angrily, "I'm not a novice myself. I've been
walking for fifty-seven years."
