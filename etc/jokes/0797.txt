The assistant minister announced to the congregation that a special
baptismal service would be held the following Sunday at three o'clock in
the afternoon, and that any infants to receive the rite should be
brought to the church at that time.

The old clergyman, who was deaf, thought that his assistant was speaking
of the new hymnals, and he added a bit of information:

"Anyone not already provided can obtain them in the vestry for a dollar,
or with red backs and speckled edges for one dollar and a half."
