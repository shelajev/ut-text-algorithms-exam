NOTHING TO SMILE AT

A Londoner was telling funny stories to a party of commercial men.

An old Scotsman, sitting in a corner seat, apparently took not the
smallest notice, and no matter how loud the laughter, went on quietly
reading his paper. This exasperated the story-teller, until at last he
said: "I think it would take an inch auger to put a joke into a
Scotsman's head."

A voice from behind the paper replied: "Ay, man, but it wid need tae hae
a finer point than ony o' yer stories, a'm thinking!"
