WHAT DID HE MEAN?

A merchant in a Wisconsin town who had a Swedish clerk sent him out to
do some collecting. When he returned from an unsuccessful trip he
reported:

"Yim Yonson say he vill pay ven he sells his hogs. Yim Olson he vill pay
ven he sell his wheat and Bill Pack say he vill pay in Yanuary."

"Well," said the boss, "that's the first time Bill ever set a date to
pay. Did he really say he would pay in January?"

"Vell, aye tank so," said the clerk, "he said it bane a dam cold day ven
you get that money. Aye tank that bane in Yanuary."
