The woman was six feet tall and broad and brawny in proportion. The man
was a short five feet, anemic and wobegone. The woman haled him before
the justice of the peace with a demand that he marry her or go to jail.

"Did you promise to marry this lady?" the justice asked.

"Guilty, your honor," was the answer.

The justice turned to the woman: "Are you determined to marry this man?"

"I am!" she snapped.

"Join hands," the justice commended. When they had done so he raised his
own right hand impressively and spoke solemnly:

"I pronounce you twain woman and husband."
