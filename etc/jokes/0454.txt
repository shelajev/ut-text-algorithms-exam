OPPORTUNITY


Many a man creates his own lack of opportunities.--_Life_.


  Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,
  Shall never find it more.

  --_Shakespeare_.


  In life's small things be resolute and great
  To keep thy muscles trained; know'st thou when fate
  Thy measure takes? or when she'll say to thee,
  "I find thee worthy, do this thing for me!"

  --_Emerson_.
