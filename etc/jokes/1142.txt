A bumptious young American farmer went to England to learn his business,
but where he went he pretended that it was far easier to teach the
farmers than to learn anything from them. "I've got an idea," he said
one day to a grizzled old Northumbrian agriculturist, "for a new kind of
fertilizer which will be ten thousand times as effective as any that has
ever been tried. Condensed fertilizer--that's what it is. Enough for an
acre of ground would go in one of my waistcoat pockets." "I don't doubt
it, young gentleman," said the veteran of the soil. "What is more,
you'll be able to put the crop into the other waistcoat pocket."
