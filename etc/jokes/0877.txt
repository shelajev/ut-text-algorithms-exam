The little girl reported at home what she had learned at Sunday School
concerning the creation of Adam and Eve:

"The teacher told us how God made the first man and the first woman. He
made the man first. But the man was very lonely with nobody to talk to
him. So God put the man to sleep. And while the man was asleep, God took
out his brains, and made a woman of them."

pleaded with a tired-looking married woman, and said:

"Just think! Wouldn't you love to go with your husband to the voting
place, and there cast your vote along with his?"

The woman shook her head decisively and she answered:

"For goodness sake! If there's one single thing that a man's able to do
by himself, let him do it."
