CAUSTIC

A good story is told of a pawky old Scot, who like many others, finds
himself rather short of cash just now. His account was £60 over drawn,
and the banker rang him up on the telephone to tell him about it, and to
suggest that he had better bring it down a bit or clear it altogether.

"Oh, aye," replied the pawky one. "I'm £60 short am I? Will ye just look
up an' tell me hoo my account stood in June?"

"Oh," the banker said, "you were all right then; you had £250 to your
credit."

"Aye, an' did I ring you up in June?" was the caustic rejoinder.
