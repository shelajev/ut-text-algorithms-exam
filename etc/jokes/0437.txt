NEATNESS


The neatness of the New England housekeeper is a matter of common
remark, and husbands in that part of the country are supposed to
appreciate their advantages.

A bit of dialogue reported as follows shows that there may be another
side to the matter.

"Martha, have you wiped the sink dry yet?" asked the farmer, as he made
final preparations for the night.

"Yes, Josiah," she replied. "Why do you ask?"

"Well, I did want a drink, but I guess I can get along until morning."
