SCOTCHED!

A parsimonious farmer notorious for the small rations he doled out to
his employees, said to a farmhand eating his breakfast,

"Jock, there's a fly in yer parritch."

The farmer stared at him. "What do ye mean?" he asked angrily; "that's
as much as sayin' ye hav'na' enough mulk."

"Oh," replied Jock still more gloomily, "there's mair than enough for
all the parritch I have."
