The lawyer for the defense, in the damage suit, asked the witness who
had seen the plaintive struck by the automobile, how far the victim was

"Fifteen feet, six and three-quarter inches," was the instant response.

"You seem to be very exact in your figures," exclaimed the lawyer
sarcastically. "How does that happen?"

"I guessed some fool lawyer would ask me," the witness answered, "and I
measured the distance."


PRECOCITY

The playwright rushed up to the critic at the club.

critic.


PREMATURENESS

Ikey saw his friend Jakey in the smoking-car when he entered, and sat
down in the same seat.

"How was that fire in your place last week, Jakey?" he inquired.

Jakey started nervously.

"Sh!" he whispered. "It vas next week."
