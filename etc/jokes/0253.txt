FAREWELLS


  Happy are we met, Happy have we been,
  Happy may we part, and Happy meet again.


A dear old citizen went to the cars the other day to see his daughter
off on a journey. Securing her a seat he passed out of the car and went
around to the car window to say a last parting word. While he was
leaving the car the daughter crossed the aisle to speak to a friend, and
at the same time a grim old maid took the seat and moved up to the
window.

Unaware of the change the old gentleman hurriedly put his head up to the
window and said: "One more kiss, pet."

In another instant the point of a cotton umbrella was thrust from the
window, followed by the wrathful injunction: "Scat, you gray-headed
wretch!"


"I am going to make my farewell tour in Shakespeare. What shall be the
play? Hamlet? Macbeth?"

"This is your sixth farewell tour, I believe."

"Well, yes."

"I would suggest 'Much Adieu About Nothing'."


  "Farewell!"
  For in that word--that fatal word--howe'er
  We promise--hope--believe--there breathes despair.

  --_Byron_.
