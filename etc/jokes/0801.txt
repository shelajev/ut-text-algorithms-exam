A visitor in the South complained bitterly concerning the plague of
mosquitoes. An aged negro who listened respectfully explained a method
by which the pests might be endured. But this was in the days before
prohibition.

"My old Marse George, suh, he done managed them animiles sholy
splendiferous. Always when he come home nights, he so completely
intoxicated he don't care a cuss foh all the skeeters in the hull
creation. In the mawnin, when Marse George done git up, the skeeters so
completely intoxicated they don't care a cuss foh Marse George, ner

MOTTO

Two men walking along Avenue A in New York City observed a dingy saloon,
in the window of which was a framed sign, reading:

"_Ici on parle fran√ßais_."

"I don't believe anybody talks French in that dump," one of the
observers remarked.

To settle the matter, they entered, and ordered ginger ale of a
red-headed barkeeper who was unmistakably Irish.

One of the men addressed the barkeeper:

"_Fait beau temps, monsieur_."

The barkeeper scowled.

"Come agin!" he demanded.

It was soon demonstrated that French was a language unknown to the
establishment.

The visitor then inquired as to the reason for the sign in the window,
explaining that it meant, "French is spoken here."

The Irish barkeeper cursed heartily.

"I bought it off a sheeny," he explained, "for six bits. He tould me it
was Latin for, 'God Bless Our Home.'"
