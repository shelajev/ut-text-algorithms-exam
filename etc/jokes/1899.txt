A FATAL STEP PREVENTED.


A BEGGAR importuned a lady for alms; she gave him a shilling. "God bless
your ladyship!" said he, "this will prevent me from executing my
resolution." The lady, alarmed, and thinking he meditated suicide, asked
what he meant. "Alas, madam!" said he, "but for this shilling I should
have been obliged to go _to work_."
