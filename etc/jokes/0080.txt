BORES


"What kind of a looking man is that chap Gabbleton you just mentioned? I
don't believe I have met him."

"Well, if you see two men off in a corner anywhere and one of them looks
bored to death, the other is Gabbleton."--_Puck_.


A man who was a well known killjoy was described as a great athlete. He
could throw a wet blanket two hundred yards in any gathering.
