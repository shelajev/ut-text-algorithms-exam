FASHION


There are two kinds of women: The fashionable ones and those who are
comfortable.--_Tom P. Morgan_.


There had been a dressmaker in the house and Minnie had listened to long
discussions about the very latest fashions. That night when she said her
prayers, she added a new petition, uttered with unwonted fervency:

"And, dear Lord, please make us all very stylish."


  Nothing is thought rare
  Which is not new, and follow'd; yet we know
  That what was worn some twenty years ago
  Comes into grace again.

  --_Beaumont and Fletcher_.


As good be out of the World as out of the Fashion.--_Colley Cibber_.
