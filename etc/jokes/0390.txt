LOST AND FOUND


"I ain't losing any faith in human nature," said Uncle Eben, "but I
kain't he'p noticin' dat dere's allus a heap mo' ahticles advertised
'Lost' dan dar is 'Found.'"


"What were you in for?" asked the friend.

"I found a horse."

"Found a horse? Nonsense! They wouldn't jug you for finding a horse."

"Well, but you see I found him before the owner lost him."


"Party that lost purse containing twenty dollars need worry no
longer--it has been found."--_Brooklyn Life_.


A lawyer having offices in a large office building recently lost a
cuff-link, one of a pair that he greatly prized. Being absolutely
certain that he had dropped the link somewhere in the building he posted
this notice:

"Lost. A gold cuff-link. The owner, William Ward, will deeply appreciate
its immediate return."

That afternoon, on passing the door whereon this notice was posted, what
were the feelings of the lawyer to observe that appended thereto were
these lines:

"The finder of the missing cuff-link would deem it a great favor if the
owner would kindly lose the other link."
