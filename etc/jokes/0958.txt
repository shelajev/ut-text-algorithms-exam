A QUALIFIED STATEMENT

"Well! we've missed that confounded train. What time will the next one
be here?"

"If the engine doesn't break down, and the track doesn't spread, and
they don't run into any cows, and the up-freight isn't behind time, and
the swing bridge isn't open, it ought to be here in about two hours."
