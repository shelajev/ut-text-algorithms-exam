LEGISLATORS


Thomas B. Reed was one of the Legislative Committee sent to inspect an
insane asylum. There was a dance on the night the committee spent in the
investigation, and Mr. Reed took for a partner one of the fair
unfortunates to whom he was introduced.

"I don't remember having seen you here before," said she; "how long have
you been in the asylum?"

"Oh, I only came down yesterday," said the gentleman, "as one of the
Legislative Committee."

"Of course," returned the lady; "how stupid I am! However, I knew you
were an inmate or a member of the Legislature the moment I looked at
you. But how was I to know? It is so difficult to know which."
