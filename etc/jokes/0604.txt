SUNDAY SCHOOLS


"Now, Willie," said the superintendent's little boy, addressing the
blacksmith's little boy, who had come over for a frolic, "we'll play
'Sabbath School.' You give me a nickel every Sunday for six months, and
then at Christmas I'll give you a ten-cent bag of candy."


When Lottie returned from her first visit to Sunday-school, she was
asked what she had learned.

"God made the world in six days and was arrested on the seventh day,"
was her version of the lesson imparted.


The teacher asked: "When did Moses live?"

After the silence had become painful she ordered: "Open your Old
Testaments. What does it say there?"

A boy answered: "Moses, 4000."

"Now," said the teacher, "why didn't you know when Moses lived?"

"Well," replied the boy, "I thought it was his telephone
number,"--_Suburban Life_.


"How many of you boys," asked the Sunday-school superintendent, "can
bring two other boys next Sunday?"

There was no response until a new recruit raised his hand hesitatingly.

"Well, William?"

"I can't bring two, but there's one little feller I can lick, and I'll
do my damnedest to bring him."
