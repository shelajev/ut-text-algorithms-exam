"Did you punish our son for throwing a lump of coal at Willie Smiggs?"

"Live within your income," was a maxim uttered by Mr. Carnegie on his
seventy-sixth birthday. This is easy; the difficulty is to live without
it.--_Satire_.


"You say your jewels were stolen while the family was at dinner?"

the ladder of fame, was deep in the throes of an unusually bad grouch

"Go smell o' the hook!"


TOM--"My pa is very religious. He always bows his head and says
something before meals."

DICK--"Mine always says something when he sits down to eat, but he don't
bow his head."

TOM--"What does he say?"

DICK--"Go easy on the butter, kids, it's forty cents a pound."
