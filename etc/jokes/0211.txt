DRAMA


The average modern play calls in the first act for all our faith, in the
second for all our hope, and in the last for all our charity.--_Eugene
Walter_.


The young man in the third row of seats looked bored. He wasn't having a
good time. He cared nothing for the Shakespearean drama.

"What's the greatest play you ever saw?" the young woman asked,
observing his abstraction.

Instantly he brightened.

"Tinker touching a man out between second and third and getting the ball
over to Chance in time to nab the runner to first!" he said.


LARRY--"I like Professor Whatishisname in Shakespeare. He brings things
home to you that you never saw before."

HARRY--"Huh! I've got a laundryman as good as that."


I think I love and reverence all arts equally, only putting my own just
above the others.... To me it seems as if when God conceived the world,
that was Poetry; He formed it, and that was Sculpture; He colored it,
and that was Painting; He peopled it with living beings, and that was
the grand, divine, eternal Drama.--_Charlotte Cushman_.


Two women were leaving the theater after a performance of "The Doll's
House."

"Oh, don't you _love_ Ibsen?" asked one, ecstatically. "Doesn't he just
take all the hope out of life?"
