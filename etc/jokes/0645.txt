TRUTH


  There was a young lady named Ruth,
  Who had a great passion for truth.
    She said she would die
    Before she would lie,
  And she died in the prime of her youth.


Women do not really like to deceive their husbands, but they are too
tender-hearted to make them unhappy by telling them the truth.


Nature ... has buried truth deep in the bottom of the
sea.--_Democritus_.


"Tis strange--but true; for truth is always strange, Stranger than
fiction."--_Byron_.
