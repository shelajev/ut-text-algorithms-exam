TROUBLESOME CUSTOMER

A woman who had visited every department of one of the big London shops
and worried the majority of the salesmen without spending a penny, so
exasperated one of them that he ventured to make a mild protest.
"Madam," he asked, "are you shopping here?"

The lady looked surprised, but not by any means annoyed. "Certainly!"
she replied. "What else should I be doing?"

For a moment the salesman hesitated; then he blurted out, "Well, madam,
I thought perhaps you were taking an inventory!"
