SOCIETY


Smart Society is made up of the worldly, the fleshy, and the
devilish.--_Harold Melbourne_.


"What are her days at home?"

"Oh, a society leader has no days at home anymore. Nowadays she has her
telephone hours."


Society consists of two classes, the upper and the lower. The latter
cultivates the dignity of labor, the former the labor of
dignity.--_Punch_.


  There was a young person called Smarty,
  Who sent out his cards for a party;
    So exclusive and few
    Were the friends that he knew
  That no one was present but Smarty.
