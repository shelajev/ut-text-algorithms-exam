LIFE


Life's an aquatic meet--some swim, some dive, some back water, some
float and the rest--sink.


  I count life just a stuff
  To try the soul's strength on.

  --_Robert Browning_.


  May you live as long as you like,
  And have what you like as long as you live.


  "Live, while you live," the epicure would say,
  "And seize the pleasures of the present day;"
  "Live, while you live," the sacred Preacher cries,
  "And give to God each moment as it flies."
  "Lord, in my views let both united be;
  I live in _pleasure_, when I live to _Thee_."

  --_Philip Doddridge_.


  This world that we're a-livin' in
    Is mighty hard to beat,
  For you get a thorn with every rose--
    But ain't the roses sweet!


Dost thou love life? Then do not squander time, for that is the stuff
life is made of.--_Benjamin Franklin_.
