The master of the house was hungry at breakfast, and swallowed a good
part of his bacon before he tasted it. Then he took time to protest
violently to his wife against the flavor of the food. The good lady
offered no apology, but rang for the servant. When the latter appeared,
the mistress asked a question that was little calculated to soothe her
husband.

"Maggie," she inquired serenely, "what did you do with the bacon we
poisoned for the rats?"


TEARS

The kind lady stopped to tell the sobbing little girl not to cry, and
she offered as a convincing argument:

"You know it makes little girls homely."

The child stared belligerently at the benevolent lady, and then
remarked:

"You must have cried an awful lot when you was young."


TENDER MEMORIES

"Please tell me, James," directed the young lady teacher, "where
shingles were first used?"

"I could, ma'am," little Jimmie replied in great embarrassment, "but I'd
rather not."


TERMINOLOGY

When the bishop was entertained at an English country house, the butler
coached carefully the new boy who was to carry up the jug of hot water
for shaving in the morning.

"When you knock," the butler explained, "and he asks, 'Who's there?'
then you must say, 'It's the boy, my Lord.'"

The lad, in much nervous trepidation, duly carried up the hot water, but
in answer to the bishop's query as to who was at the door, he announced:

"It's the Lord, my boy!"

The butler overheard and was horrified. He hammered into the youth's
consciousness, the fact that a bishop must be addressed as my lord.
Finally, he was satisfied that the boy understood, and permitted him to
assist in serving the dinner that night. The youngster was sent to the
bishop to offer a plate of cheese. With shaking knees, he presented the
dish to the prelate, and faltered:

"My God, will you have some cheese?"
