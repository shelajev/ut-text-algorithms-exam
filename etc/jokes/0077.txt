BOOKSELLERS AND BOOKSELLING


A bookseller reports these mistakes of customers in sending orders:

  AS ORDERED                 CORRECT TITLE
  _Lame as a Roble_          _Les Mis√©rables_
  _God's Image in Mud_       _God's Image in Man_
  _Pair of Saucers_          _Paracelsus_
  _Pierre and His Poodle_    _Pierre and His People_


When a customer in a Boston department store asked a clerk for Hichens's
_Bella Donna_, the reply was, "Drug counter, third aisle over."


It was a few days before Christmas in one of New York's large
book-stores.

CLERK--"What is it, please?"

CUSTOMER--"I would like Ibsen's _A Doll's House_."

CLERK--"To cut out?"
