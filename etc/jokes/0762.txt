Little Alice questioned her mother concerning heaven, and seemed pleased
to be assured that she would have wings and harp and crown.

"And candy, too, mamma?"

The mother shook her head.

"Anyhow," Alice declared, "I'm tickled we have such a fine doctor."


HEREDITY

The woman, who had a turn-up nose and was somewhat self-conscious
concerning it, bought a new pug dog, and petted it so fondly as to
excite the jealousy of her little daughter.

"How do you like your new little brother?" she asked the child
teasingly.

The girl replied, rather maliciously, perhaps:

"He looks just like his muvver."


HIGH PRICES

Two men were talking together in the Public Library. One of them said:

"The dime novel has gone. I wonder where it's gone to?"

The other, who knew something of literature in its various phases,
answered cynically:

"It's gone up to a dollar and ninety cents."


HINDSIGHT

Mike, the hod-carrier, was still somewhat fuddled when he arose Monday
morning, with the result that he put on his overalls wrong side to; with
the further result, that he was careless while mounting the ladder later
with a load of bricks, and fell to the ground. As he raised himself into
a sitting position, a fellow workman asked solicitously:

"Are yez kilt intoirly, Mike?"

Mike, with drooping head, stared down dully at the seat of his overalls,
and shook his head.

"No," he declared in a tone of awe, "I'm not kilt, but I'm terrible
twisted."
