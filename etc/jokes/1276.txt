A MAGIC HEALER

During an exciting game of football a player had two fingers of his
right hand badly smashed, and on his way home from the ground he dropped
into the doctor's to have them attended to.

"Doctor," he asked, anxiously. "When this hand of mine heals, will I be
able to play the piano?"

"Certainly you will," the doctor assured him.

"Then you're a wonder, doctor. I never could before."
