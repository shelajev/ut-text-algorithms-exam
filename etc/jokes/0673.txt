WISHES


George Washington drew a long sigh and said: "Ah wish Ah had a hundred
watermillions."

Dixie's eyes lighted. "Hum! Dat would suttenly be fine! An' ef yo' had a
hundred watermillions would yo' gib me fifty?"

"No, Ah wouldn't."

"Wouldn't yo' give me twenty-five?"

"No, Ah wouldn't gib yo' no twenty-five."

Dixie gaxed with reproachful eyes at his close-fisted friend. "Seems to
me, you's powahful stingy, George Washington," he said, and then
continued in a heartbroken voice. "Wouldn't yo' gib me one?"

"No, Ah wouldn't gib yo' one. Look a' heah, nigger! Are yo' so good for
nuffen lazy dat yo' cahn't wish fo' yo' own watermillions?"


  "Man wants but little here below
    Nor wants that little long,"
  'Tis not with me exactly so;
    But'tis so in the song.
  My wants are many, and, if told,
    Would muster many a score;
  And were each a mint of gold,
    I still should long for more.

  --_John Quincy Adams_.
