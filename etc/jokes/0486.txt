PRAISE


WIFE (complainingly)--"You never praise me up to any one."

HUB--"I don't, eh! You should hear me describe you at the intelligence
office when I'm trying to hire a cook."


"What sort of a man is he?"

"Well, he's just what I've been looking for--a generous soul, with a
limousine body."--_Life_.
