WEALTH


If you want to make a living you have to work for it, while if you want
to get rich you must go about it in some other way.


The traditional fool and his money are lucky ever to have got together
in the first place.--_Puck_.


He that is proud of riches is a fool. For if he be exalted above his
neighbors because he hath more gold, how much inferior is he to a gold
mine!--_Jeremy Taylor_.
