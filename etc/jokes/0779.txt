The tender young mother detected her baby boy in a deliberate lie. With
tears in her eyes, and a catch in her voice, she sought to impress upon
him the enormity of his offense.

"Do you know," she questioned severely, "what happens to little boys who
tell falsehoods?"

The culprit shook his head in great distress, and the mother explained
carefully:

"Why, a great big black man, with horns on his head and one eye in the
center of his forehead, comes along and grabs the little boy who has
told a falsehood, and flies with him up to the moon, and keeps him there
sifting ashes all the rest of his life. You won't ever tell another
falsehood, will you, darling? It's wicked!"

Mother's baby boy regarded the speaker with round-eyed admiration.

"Oh, ma," he gurgled, "what a whopper!"


MAIDENS

"I wish I could know how many men will be made wretched when I get
married," said the languishing coquette to her most intimate confidante.

"I'll tell you," came the catty answer, "if you'll tell me how many men
you're going to marry."


MAIDEN SPEECH

The unhappy man explained the cause of his wretchedness:

"I've never made a speech in my life. But last night at the dinner at
the club they insisted on my making some remarks, and I got up, and
began like this:

"As I was sitting on my thought, a seat struck me."


MANNERS

It is told of Prince Herbert Bismarck that at a reception in the Royal
Palace in Berlin he rudely jostled a high dignitary of the Italian
church. In answer to the prelate's expression of annoyance, the Prince
drew himself haughtily erect, and said, "I am Herbert Bismarck."

"Ah," replied the churchman, "that fact is perhaps an apology;
certainly, it is a complete explanation."
