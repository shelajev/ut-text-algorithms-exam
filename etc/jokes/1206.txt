NO NONSENSE ABOUT IT

The new vicar was paying a visit amongst the patients in the local
hospital. When he entered Ward No. 2, he came across a pale-looking man
lying in a cot, heavily swathed in bandages. There he stopped, and after
administering a few words of comfort to the unfortunate sufferer, he
remarked in cheering tones:

"Never mind, my man, you'll soon be all right. Keep on smiling; that's
the way in the world."

"I shall never smile again," replied the youth, sadly.

"Nonsense!" ejaculated the vicar.

"There ain't no nonsense about it!" exclaimed the other, heatedly. "It's
through smiling at another chap's girl that I'm here now."
