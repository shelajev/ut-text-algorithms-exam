BUSINESS


A Boston lawyer, who brought his wit from his native Dublin, while
cross-examining the plaintiff in a divorce trial, brought forth the
following:

"You wish to divorce this woman because she drinks?"

"Yes, sir."

"Do you drink yourself?"

"That's _my_ business!" angrily.

Whereupon the unmoved lawyer asked: "Have you any other business?"


At the Boston Immigration Station one blank was recently filled out as
follows:

Name--Abraham Cherkowsky.
Born--Yes.
Business--Rotten.
