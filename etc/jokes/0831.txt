As the boat was sinking, the skipper lifted his voice to ask:

"Does anybody know how to pray?"

One man spoke confidently in answer:

"Yes, Captain, I do."

The captain nodded.

"That's all right then," he declared. "You go ahead and pray. The rest
of us will put on life-belts. They're one short."


PREACHER

A colored deacon who was the leader in a congregation down South, wrote
to the bishop to explain the need of a minister for the church. He
concluded his appeal as follows:

"Send us a Bishop to preach. If you can't send us a Bishop, send us a
Sliding Elder. If you can't send a Sliding Elder, send us a Stationary
Preacher. If you can't spare him, send us a Circus Eider. If you can't
spare him, send us a Locust Preacher. And if you can't send a Locust
Preacher, send us an Exhauster."


PRECAUTION

When the colored couple were being married by the clergyman, and the
words, "love, honor and obey" were spoken, the bridegroom interrupted:

"Read that again, suh! read it once moh, so's de lady kin ketch de full
solemnity ob de meanin'. I'se been married befoh."
