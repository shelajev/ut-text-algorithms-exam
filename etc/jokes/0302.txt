GOOD FELLOWSHIP


  A glass is good, a lass is good,
    And a pipe to smoke in cold weather,
  The world is good and the people are good,
    And we're all good fellows together.


  May good humor preside when good fellows meet,
  And reason prescribe when'tis time to retreat.


Here's to us that are here, to you that are there, and the rest of us
everywhere.


  Here's to all the world,--
  For fear some darn fool may take offence.
