A HUMBLING SIGHT

An old Scotchwoman, who had resisted all entreaties of her friends to
have her photo taken, was at last induced to employ the services of a
local artist in order to send her likeness to a son in America. On
receiving the first impression she failed to recognise the figure
thereon depicted as herself; so, card in hand, she set out for the
artist's studio to ask if there was no mistake.

"Is that me?" she queried.

"Yes, madam," replied the artist.

"And is it like me?" she again asked.

"Yes, madam; it's a speaking likeness."

"Aweel!" she said, resignedly, "it's a humblin' sicht."
