TALKING SENSE

"Darling," he asked, as he drew his fianc√©e closer to him, "am I the
first man you have ever kissed?"

"William," replied the American girl, somewhat testily, "before we go
any further I would like to ask you a few questions. You are, no doubt,
fully aware that my father is a millionaire something like ten times
over, aren't you?"

"Y-yes."

"You understand, no doubt, that when he dies all of his vast fortune
will be left to me?"

"Y-yes."

"You know that I have a quarter of a million dollars in cash in my name
at the bank?"

"Y-yes."

"And own two and a half million dollars' worth of property?"

"Y-yes."

"That my diamonds are insured to the value of a quarter of a million
dollars?"

"Y-yes."

"My horses and motor-cars are worth seventy-five thousand dollars?"

"Y-yes."

"Then, for goodness' sake, talk sense! What difference would it make to
you if I had been kissed by a thousand men before I met you?"
