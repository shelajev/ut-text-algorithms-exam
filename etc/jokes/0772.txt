The young man addressed the old grouch:

"When a fellow has taken a girl to a show, and fed her candy, and given
her supper, and taken her home in a taxi, shouldn't she let a fellow
kiss her good-night?"

The old grouch snorted.

"Humph! He's already done more than enough for her."


KISSING

The subject of kissing was debated with much earnestness for a half hour
between the girl and her young man caller. The fellow insisted that it
was always possible for a man to kiss a girl at will, whether she chose
to permit it or not. The maiden was firm in maintaining that such was
not the case. Finally, it was decided that the only solution of the
question must be by a practical demonstration one way or the other. So,
they tried it. They clinched, and the battle was on. After a lively
tussle, they broke away. The girl had been kissed--ardently for a period
of minutes. Her comment showed an undaunted spirit:

"Oh, well, you really didn't win fair. My foot slipped.... Let's try it
again."
