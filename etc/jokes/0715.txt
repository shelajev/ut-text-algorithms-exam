A member of the faculty in a London medical college was appointed an
honorary physician to the king. He proudly wrote a notice, on the
blackboard in his class-room:

"Professor Jennings informs his students that he has been appointed
honorary physician to His Majesty, King George."

When he returned to the class-room in the afternoon he found written
below his notice this line:

"God save the King."
