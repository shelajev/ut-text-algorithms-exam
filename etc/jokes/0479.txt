POETS


EDITOR--"Have you submitted this poem anywhere else?"

JOKESMITH--"No, sir."

EDITOR--"Then where did you get that black eye?"--_Satire_.


"Why is it," asked the persistent poetess, "that you always insist that
we write on one side of the paper only? Why not on both?"

In that moment the editor experienced an access of courage--courage to
protest against the accumulated wrongs of his kind.

"One side of the paper, madame," he made answer, "is in the nature of a
compromise."

"A compromise?"

"A compromise. What we really desire, if we could have our way, is not
one, or both, but neither."


Sir Lewis Morris was complaining to Oscar Wilde about the neglect of his
poems by the press. "It is a complete conspiracy of silence against me,
a conspiracy of silence. What ought I to do, Oscar?" "Join it," replied
Wilde.


  God's prophets of the Beautiful,
  These Poets were.

  --_E.B. Browning_.


  We call those poets who are first to mark
  Through earth's dull mist the coming of the dawn,--
  Who see in twilight's gloom the first pale spark,
  While others only note that day is gone.

  --_O.W. Holmes_.
