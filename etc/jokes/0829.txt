              *       *       *

A little boy was asked if he prayed when he attended church, and he
answered that he always did. On being questioned as to the nature of his
prayer, he explained that he always repeated it when the others in the
congregation made their silent prayer just before the sermon, and he
added further:

"I just say the little prayer mother taught me--'Now I lay me down to
sleep.'"
