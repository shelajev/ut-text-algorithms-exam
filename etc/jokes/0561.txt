SENATORS


A Senator is very often a man who has risen from obscurity to something
worse.


"You have been conspicuous in the halls of legislation, have you not?"

An aviator alighted on a field and said to a rather well-dressed
individual: "Here, mind my machine a minute, will you?"

"What?" the well-dressed individual snarled. "Me mind your machine? Why,
I'm a United States Senator!"

"Well, what of it?" said the aviator. "I'll trust you."
