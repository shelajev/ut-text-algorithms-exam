WINE


  When our thirsty souls we steep,
  Every sorrow's lull'd to sleep.
  Talk of monarchs! we are then
  Richest, happiest, first of men.

  When I drink, my heart refines
  And rises as the cup declines;
  Rises in the genial flow,
  That none but social spirits know.

  To-day we'll haste to quaff our wine,
  As if to-morrow ne'er should shine;
  But if to-morrow comes, why then--
  We'll haste to quaff our wine again.

  Let me, oh, my budding vine,
  Spill no other blood than thine.
  Yonder brimming goblet see,
  That alone shall vanquish me.

  I pray thee, by the gods above,
  Give me the mighty howl I love,
  And let me sing, in wild delight.
  "I will--I will be mad to-night!"

  When Father Time swings round his scythe,
  Intomb me 'neath the bounteous vine,
  So that its juices red and blythe,
  May cheer these thirsty bones of mine.

  --_Eugene Field_.
