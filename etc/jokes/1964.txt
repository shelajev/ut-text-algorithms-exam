A TRICK.


THE following story is told of a boy who was asked to take a jug and get
some beer for his father, who had spent all his money for strong drink.
"Give me the money, then, father," replied the son.

"My son, any body can get the beer with money, but to get it without
money, that is a trick."

So the boy took the jug and went out. Shortly he returned, and placing
the jug before his father, said, "Drink."

"How can I drink, when there is no beer in the jug?"

"To drink beer out of a jug," says the boy, "where there is beer,
anybody could do that; but to drink beer out of a jug where there is no
beer, that is a trick!"
