CRITICISM


FIRST MUSIC CRITIC--"I wasted a whole evening by going to that new
pianist's concert last night!"

SECOND MUSIC CRITIC--"Why?"

FIRST MUSIC CRITIC--"His playing was above criticism!"


                               As soon
   Seek roses in December--ice in June,
   Hope, constancy in wind, or corn in chaff;
   Believe a woman or an epitaph,
   Or any other thing that's false, before
   You trust in critics.

  --_Byron_.


It is much easier to be critical than to be correct.--_Disraeli_.
