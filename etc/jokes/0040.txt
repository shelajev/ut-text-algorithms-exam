ATTENTION


The supervisor of a school was trying to prove that children are lacking
in observation.

To the children he said, "Now, children, tell me a number to put on the
board."

Some child said, "Thirty-six." The supervisor wrote sixty-three.

He asked for another number, and seventy-six was given. He wrote
sixty-seven.

When a third number was asked, a child who apparently had paid no
attention called out:

"Theventy-theven. Change _that_ you thucker!"
