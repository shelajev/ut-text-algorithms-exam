AMERICAN GIRL


  Here's to the dearest
    Of all things on earth.
  (Dearest precisely--
    And yet of full worth.)
  One who lays siege to
    Susceptible hearts.
  (Pocket-books also--
    That's one of her arts!)
  Drink to her, toast her,
    Your banner unfurl--
  Here's to the _priceless_
    American Girl!

  --_Walter Pulitzer_.
