SYMPATHY.


A GOOD deacon making an official visit to a dying neighbor, who was a
very churlish and universally unpopular man, put the usual
question--"Are you willing to go, my friend?"

"Oh, yes," said the sick man, "I am."

"Well," said the simple minded deacon, "I am glad you are, for _all the
neighbors are willing_!"
