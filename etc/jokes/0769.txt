The curiosity of the passenger was excited by the fact that his seatmate
had his right arm in a sling, and the following dialogue occurred:

"You broke your arm, didn't you?"

"Well, yes, I did."

"Had an accident, I suppose?"

"Not exactly. I did it in trying to pat myself on the back."

"My land! On the back! Now, whatever did you want to pat yourself on the
back for?"

"Just for minding my own business."


INSOMNIA

The man suffering from insomnia quite often makes a mistake in calling
the doctor, when what he needs is the preacher.


INSULT

The young wife greeted her husband tearfully on his return from the
day's work.

"Oh, Willie, darling," she gasped, "I have been so insulted!"

"Insulted!" Willie exclaimed wrathfully. "Insulted by whom?"

"By your mother!" the wife declared, and sobbed aloud.

The husband was aghast, but inclined to be skeptical.

"By my mother, Ella? Why, dearest, that's nonsense. She's a hundred
miles away."

"But she did," the wife insisted. "A letter came to you this morning,
and it was addressed in your mother's writing, so, of course, I opened
it."

"Oh, yes, of course," Willie agreed, without any enthusiasm.

"And it was written to you all the whole way through, every word of it,
except----"

"Except what?"

"Except the postscript," the wife flared. "That was the insult--that was
to me." The tears flowed again. "It said: 'P. S.--Dear Ella, don't fail
to give this letter to Willie. I want him to read it.'"
