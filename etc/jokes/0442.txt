NEWS


Soon after the installation of the telegraph in Fredericksburg,
Virginia, a little darky, the son of my father's mammy, saw a piece of
newspaper that had blown up on the telegraph wires and caught there.
Running to my grandmother in a great state of excitement, he cried,
"Miss Liza, come quick! Dem wires done buss and done let all the news
out!"--_Sue M.M. Halsey_.


"Our whole neighborhood has been stirred up," said the regular reader.

The editor of the country weekly seized his pen. "Tell me about it," he
said. "What we want is news. What stirred it up?"

"Plowing," said the farmer.


There is nothing new except what is forgotten.--_Mademoiselle Berlin_.
