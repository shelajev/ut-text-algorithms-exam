They were talking over the days that will never return, so they
asserted; the days when there was no thirst in the land. But they had
particular reference to the old state militia camp of long ago. For be
it known, there was much taken to camp in those days that had little to
do with military training, and it was carried in capacious jugs and big
bottles. Everybody expected his city friends to run down to the camp,
and be called upon to act as an assuager of thirst. "The year I have
reference to," said one of the old-timers, "was a notably wet one. The
first night in camp everybody seemed to be bent on sampling what
everybody else had brought down from the city. The result was that when
the company of which I was a member was ordered to fall in the next
morning to answer the roll-call there was a pretty wobbly line-up. We
had a new sergeant--new to the routine of a camp, and after he had
checked up he should have reported, 'Sir, the company is present and
accounted for.' Instead he got rattled and said, 'Sir, the company is
full.' Our captain, looking us over, sarcastically remarked, 'I should
say as much, full as a tick.'"
