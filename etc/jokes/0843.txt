The young man, who was notorious for the reckless driving of his car,
was at his home in the country, when he received a telephone call, and a
woman's voice asked if he intended to go motoring that afternoon.

"No, not this afternoon," he replied. "But why do you ask? Who are you?"

"That doesn't matter," came the voice over the wire. "It's only that I
wish to send my little girl down the street on an errand."
