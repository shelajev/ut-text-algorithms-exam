SUSPICIOUS

It was while on manoeuvres in rural England, and a soldier was being
tried for the shooting of a chicken on prohibited ground.

"Look here, my man," said the commanding officer to the farmer who
brought the accusation, "are you quite certain that this is the man who
shot your bird? Will you swear to him?"

"No, I won't do that," replied the farmer, "but I will say he's the man
I suspect o' doing it."

"That's not enough to convict a man," retorted the C. O., considerably
nettled. "What raised your suspicions?"

"Well," replied the sturdy yeoman, "it was this way--I see 'im on my
property with a gun; then I heerd the gun go off; then I see 'im putting
the chicken in his knapsack; and it didn't seem sense nohow to think the
bird committed suicide."
