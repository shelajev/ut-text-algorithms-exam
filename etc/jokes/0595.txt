STENOGRAPHERS


A beautiful statuesque blond had left New York to act as stenographer to
a dignified Philadelphian of Quaker descent. On the morning of her first
appearance she went straight to the desk of her employer.

"I presume," she remarked, "that you begin the day over here the same as
they do in New York?"

"Oh, yes," replied the employer, without glancing up from a letter he
was reading.

"Well, hurry up and kiss me, then," was the startling rejoinder, "I want
to get to work."
