EGOTISM


In the Chicago schools a boy refused to sew, thinking it below the
dignity of a man of ten years.

"Why," said the teacher, "George Washington did his own sewing in the
wars, and do you think you are better than George Washington?"

"I don't know," replied the boy seriously. "Only time can tell that."


John D. Rockefeller tells this story on himself:

"Golfing one bright winter day I had for caddie a boy who didn't know
me.

"An unfortunate stroke landed me in clump of high grass.

"'My, my,' I said, 'what am I to do now?'

"'See that there tree?' said the boy, pointing to a tall tree a mile
away. 'Well, drive straight for that.'

"I lofted vigorously, and, fortunately, my ball soared up into the air;
it landed, and it rolled right on to the putting green.

"'How's that, my boy?' I cried.

"The caddie stared at me with envious eyes.

"'Gee, boss,' he said, 'if I had your strength and you had my brains
what a pair we'd make!'"


The late Marshall Field had a very small office-boy who came to the
great merchant one day with a request for an increase in wages.

"Huh!" said Mr. Field, looking at him as if through a magnifying-glass.
"Want a raise, do you? How much are you getting?"

"Three dollars a week," chirped the little chap.

"Three dollars a week!" exclaimed his employer. "Why, when I was your
age I only got two dollars."

"Oh, well, that's different," piped the youngster. "I guess you weren't
worth any more."


  Here's to the man who is wisest and best,
  Here's to the man who with judgment is blest.
  Here's to the man who's as smart as can be--
  I mean the man who agrees with me.
