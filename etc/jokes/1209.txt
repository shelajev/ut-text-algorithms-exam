HE HAD HEARD OF THEM

It was company field training. The captain saw a young soldier trying to
cook his breakfast with a badly-made fire. Going to him, he showed him
how to make a quick-cooking fire, saying: "Look at the time you are
wasting. When I was in the Himalayas I often had to hunt my breakfast. I
used to go about two miles in the jungle, shoot my food, skin or pluck
it, then cook and eat it, and return to the camp under half an hour."
Then he unwisely added, "Of course, you will have heard of the
Himalayas?"

"Yes, sir," replied the young soldier, "and also of Ananias and George
Washington."
