AEROPLANES


  "Mother, may I go aeroplane?"
    "Yes, my darling Mary.
  Tie yourself to an anchor chain
    And don't go near the airy."

  --_Judge_.


Harry N. Atwood, the noted aviator, was the guest of honor at a dinner
in New York, and on the occasion his eloquent reply to a toast on
aviation terminated neatly with these words:

"The aeroplane has come at last, but it was a long time coming. We can
imagine Necessity, the mother of invention, looking up at a sky all
criss-crossed with flying machines, and then saying, with a shake of her
old head and with a contented smile:

"'Of all my family, the aeroplane has been the hardest to raise.'"


  A genius who once did aspire
  To invent an aerial flyer,
    When asked, "Does it go?"
    Replied, "I don't know;
  I'm awaiting some damphule to try 'er."
