A G. A. R. veteran told to some members of the American Legion the story
of a private in the Civil War, who during the first battle of Bull Run
found a post hole into which he lowered himself, so that only his eyes
were above the level of the ground. An officer, noting this display of
cowardice, darted to the spot, and with a threatening gesture of his
sword, shouted fiercely, "get out of that hole!"

But the skulker did not come out. On the contrary, he put his thumb to
his nose and waggled his fingers insultingly.

"Not on your life," he retorted. "Hunt a hole for yourself. This belongs
to me."
