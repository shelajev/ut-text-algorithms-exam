AGRICULTURE


A farmer, according to this definition, is a man who makes his money on
the farm and spends it in town. An agriculturist is a man who makes his
money in town and spends it on the farm.


In certain parts of the west, where without irrigation the cultivators
of the land would be in a bad way indeed, the light rains that during
the growing season fall from time to time, are appreciated to a degree
that is unknown in the east.

Last summer a fruit grower who owns fifty acres of orchards was
rejoicing in one of these precipitations of moisture, when his hired man
came into the house.

"Why don't you stay in out of the rain?" asked the fruit-man.

"I don't mind a little dew like this," said the man. "I can work along
just the same."

"Oh, I'm not talking about that," exclaimed the fruit-man. "The next
time it rains, you can come into the house. I want that water on the
land."


  They used to have a farming rule
  Of forty acres and a mule.
  Results were won by later men
  With forty square feet and a hen.
  And nowadays success we see
  With forty inches and a bee.

Blessed be agriculture! if one does not have too much of it.--_Charles
Dudley Warner_.


When tillage begins, other arts follow. The farmers, therefore, are the
founders of human civilization.--_Daniel Webster_.
