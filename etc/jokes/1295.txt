NOT STRONG ENOUGH

Muriel, aged four, was taken by her governess to have tea with an aunt.
Presently she began to eat a piece of very rich cake.

"Oh, I just love this chocolate cake!" she exclaimed. "It's awfully
nice."

"Muriel, dear," corrected her governess, "it is wrong to say you 'love'
cake, and I've frequently pointed out that 'just' is wrongly used in
such a sentence. Again, 'awfully' is quite wrong, 'very' would be more
correct, dear. Now repeat your remark, please."

Muriel obediently repeated: "I like chocolate cake; it is very good."

"That's better, dear," said the governess, approvingly.

"But it sounds as if I was talking about bread," protested the little
girl.
