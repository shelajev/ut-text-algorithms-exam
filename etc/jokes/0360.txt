IRREVERENCE


  There were three young women of Birmingham,
  And I know a sad story concerning 'em:
    They stuck needles and pins
    In the reverend shins
  Of the Bishop engaged in confirming 'em.

  --_Gilbert K. Chesterton_.


A few years ago Henry James reviewed a new novel by Gertrude Atherton.
After reading the review Mrs. Atherton wrote to Mr. James as follows:

    "Dear Mr. James: I have read with much pleasure your review of
    my novel. Will you kindly let me know whether you liked it or
    not?"

    Sincerely,

    "GERTRUDE ATHERTON."
