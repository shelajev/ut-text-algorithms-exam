PROMPTNESS


"Are you first in anything at school, Earlie?"

"First out of the building when the bell rings."


The head of a large business house bought a number of those "Do it now"
signs and hung them up around his offices. When, after the first few
days of those signs, the business man counted up the results, he found
that the cashier had skipped out with $20,000, the head bookkeeper had
eloped with the stenographer, three clerks had asked for a raise in
salary, and the office boy had lit out for the west to become a
highwayman.


"Are you waiting for me, dear?" she said, coming downstairs at last,
after spending half an hour fixing her hat.

"Waiting," exclaimed the impatient man. "Oh no, not
waiting--sojourning."
