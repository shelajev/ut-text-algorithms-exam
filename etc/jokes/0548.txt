ROADS


A Yankee just returning to the states was dining with an Englishman, and
the latter complained of the mud in America.

"Yes," said the American, "but it's nothing to the mud over here."

"Nonsense!" said the Englishman.

"Fact," the American replied. "Why, this afternoon I had a remarkable
adventure--came near getting into trouble with an old gentleman--all
through your confounded mud."

"Some of the streets are a little greasy at this season, I admit," said
the Englishman. "What was your adventure, though?"

"Well," said the American, "as I was walking along I noticed that the
mud was very thick, and presently I saw a high hat afloat on a large
puddle of very rich ooze. Thinking to do some one a kindness, I gave the
hat a poke with my stick, when an old gentleman looked up from beneath,
surprised and frowning. 'Hello!' I said. 'You're in pretty deep!'
'Deeper than you think,' he said. 'I'm on the top of an omnibus!'"
