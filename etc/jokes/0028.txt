ANGER


Charlie and Nancy had quarreled. After their supper Mother tried to
re-establish friendly relations. She told them of the Bible verse, "Let
not the sun go down upon your wrath."

"Now, Charlie," she pleaded, "are you going to let the sun go down on
your wrath?"

Charlie squirmed a little. Then:

"Well, how can _I_ stop it?"


When a husband loses his temper he usually finds his wife's.


It is easy enough to restrain our wrath when the other fellow is the
bigger.
