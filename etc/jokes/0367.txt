JURY


In the south of Ireland a judge heard his usher of the court say,
"Gentlemen of the jury, take your proper places," and was convulsed with
laughter at seeing seven of them walk into the dock.


There was recently haled into an Alabama court a little Irishman to whom
the thing was a new experience. He was, however, unabashed, and wore an
air of a man determined not to "get the worst of it."

"Prisoner at the bar," called out the clerk, "do you wish to challenge
any of the jury?"

The Celt looked the men in the box over very carefully.

"Well, I tell ye," he finally replied, "Oi'm not exactly in trainin',
but Oi think Oi could pull off a round or two with thot fat old boy in
th' corner."


JUSTICE


There are two sides to every question-the wrong side and our side.


"What, Tommy, in the jam again, and you whipped for it only an hour
ago!"

"Yes'm, but I heard you tell Auntie that you thought you whipped me too
hard, so I thought I'd just even up."


  One man's word is no man's word,
  Justice is that both be heard.


He who decides a case without hearing the other side, though he decide
justly cannot be considered just.--_Seneca_.
