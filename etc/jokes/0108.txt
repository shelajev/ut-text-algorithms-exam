CATS


  There was a young lady whose dream
  Was to feed a black cat on whipt cream,
    But the cat with a bound
    Spilt the milk on the ground,
  So she fed a whipt cat on black cream.


  There once were two cats in Kilkenny,
  And each cat thought that there was one cat too many,
  And they scratched and they fit and they tore and they bit,
  'Til instead of two cats--there weren't any.
