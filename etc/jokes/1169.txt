WRONG BROTHER

A wealthy gentleman has a brother who is hard of hearing, while he
himself is remarkable for having a very prominent nose.

Once, this gentleman dined at a friend's house, where he sat between two
young ladies who talked to him very loudly, rather to his annoyance.

Finally one of them shouted a commonplace remark and then said in an
ordinary tone to the other:

"Did you ever see such an ugly nose?"

"Pardon me, ladies," said the gentleman. "It is my brother who is deaf."
