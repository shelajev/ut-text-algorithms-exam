WEDDING PRESENTS


Among the presents lately showered upon a dusky bride in a rural section
of Virginia, was one that was a gift of an old woman with whom both
bride and groom were great favorites.

Some time ago, it appears, the old woman accumulated a supply of
cardboard mottoes, which she worked and had framed as occasion arose.

So it happened that in a neat combination of blues and reds, suspended
by a cord of orange, there hung over the table whereon the other
presents were displayed for the delectation of the wedding guests, this
motto:

    FIGHT ON; FIGHT EVER.
