RESEMBLANCES


Senator Blackburn is a thorough Kentuckian, and has all the local pride
of one born in the blue-grass section of his State. He also has the
prejudice against being taken for an Indianian which seems inherent in
all native-born Kentuckians. While coming to Congress, several sessions
ago, he was approached in the Pullman coach by a New Yorker, who, after
bowing politely to him, said:

"Is not this Senator Blackburn of Indiana?"

The Kentuckian sprang from his seat, and glaring at his interlocutor
exclaimed angrily:

"No, sir, by ----. The reason I look so bad is I have been sick!"


"Every time the baby looks into my face he smiles," said Mr. Meekins.

"Well," answered his wife, "it may not be exactly polite, but it shows
he has a sense of humor."


Mark Twain constantly received letters and photographs from men who had
been told that they looked like him. One was from Florida, and the
likeness, as shown by the man's picture, was really remarkable so
remarkable, indeed, that Mr. Clemens sent the following acknowledgment:

    "My Dear Sir: I thank you very much for your letter and the
    photograph. In my opinion you are certainly more like me than
    any other of my doubles. In fact, I am sure that if you stood
    before me in a mirrorless frame I could shave by you."


NEIGHBOR: "Johnny, I think in looks you favor your mother a great deal."

JOHNNY: "Well. I may look like her, but do you tink dat's a favor?"
