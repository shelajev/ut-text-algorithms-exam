AN ELIGIBLE CORPS.


MR. BENSLEY, before he went on the stage, was a captain in the army. One
day he met a Scotch officer who had been in the same regiment. The
latter was happy to meet his old messmate, but was ashamed to be seen
with a player. He therefore hurried Bensley to an unfrequented
coffee-house, where he asked him very seriously, "Hoo could ye disgrace
the corps by turning a play-actor?" Mr. Bensley answered, that he by no
means considered it in that light; on the contrary, that a respectable
performer of good conduct was much esteemed, and kept the best company.
"And what, man," said the other, "do you get by this business of yours?"
"I have," replied Mr. B., "at present an income of near a thousand a
year." "A thousand a year!" exclaimed Saunders, astonished, "_hae ye ony
vacancies in your corps?_"
