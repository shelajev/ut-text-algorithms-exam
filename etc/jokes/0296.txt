GENTLEMEN


"Sadie, what is a gentleman?"

"Please, ma'am," she answered, "a gentleman's a man you don't know very
well."


Two characters in Jeffery Farnol's "Amateur Gentleman" give these
definitions of a gentleman:

"A gentleman is a fellow who goes to a university, but doesn't have to
learn anything; who goes out into the world, but doesn't have to work at
anything; and who has never been black-balled at any of the clubs."

"A gentleman is (I take it) one born with the God-like capacity to think
and feel for others, irrespective of their rank or condition.... One who
possesses an ideal so lofty, a mind so delicate, that it lifts him above
all things ignoble and base, yet strengthens his hands to raise those
who are fallen--no matter how low."
