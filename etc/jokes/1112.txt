A CLOSE CALL

Pat was a simple country yokel who had never strayed from the outskirts
of his native village, and because he stood in a railway station for the
first time of his life, his amazement was great.

The vastness of his surroundings completely dazzled him, but when the
3.30 express dashed through the station, that did it. He kept his eyes
glued on the tunnel through which it had disappeared, staring after it
as though some kind of miracle had happened. He remained like this for
several minutes, much to the amusement of the onlookers, until at length
an inquisitive porter asked him what he was staring at.

"Oi was just thinkun'," he said, pulling himself together, "what a
terribal smash there'd 'a' bin if he'd 'a' missed the 'ole!"
