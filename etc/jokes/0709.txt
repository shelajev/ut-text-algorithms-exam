Ted had a habit of dropping in at the house next door on baking day, for
the woman of that house had a deft way in the making of cookies, and Ted
had no hesitation in enjoying her hospitality, even to the extent of
asking for cookies if they were not promptly forthcoming.

When the boy's father learned of this, he gave Ted a lecture and a
strict order never to ask for cookies at the neighbor's kitchen. So,
when a few days later the father saw his son munching a cookie as he
came away from the next house, he spoke sternly:

"Have you been begging cookies again?"

"Oh, no, I didn't beg any," Ted answered cheerfully. "I just said, this
house smells as if it was full of cookies. But what's that to me?"
