REMEDIES


MISTRESS--"Did the mustard plaster do you any good, Bridget?"

MAID--"Yes; but, begorry, mum, it do bite the tongue!"


SUFFERER--"I have a terrible toothache and want something to cure it."

FRIEND--"Now, you don't need any medicine. I had a toothache yesterday
and I went home and my loving wife kissed me and so consoled me that the
pain soon passed away. Why don't you try the same?"

SUFFERER--"I think I will. Is your wife at home now?"


  For every ill beneath the sun
  There is some remedy or none;
  If there be one, resolve to find it;
  If not, submit, and never mind it.
