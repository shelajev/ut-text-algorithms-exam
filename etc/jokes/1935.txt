MISTAKEN THIS TIME.


COL. MOORE, a veteran politician of the Old Dominion, was a most
pleasant and affable gentleman, and a great lisper withal. He was known
by a great many, and professed to know many more; but a story is told of
him in which he failed to convince either himself or the stranger of
their previous acquaintance. All things to all men, he met a countryman,
one morning, and in his usual hearty manner stopped and shook hands with
him, saying--

"Why, how _do_ you do, thir? am very glad to thee you; a fine day, thir,
I thee you thill ride the old gray, thir."

"No, Sir, this horse is one I borrowed this morning."

"Oh! ah! Well, thir, how are the old gentleman and lady?"

"My parents have been dead about three years, Sir!"

"But how ith your wife, thir, and the children?"

"I am an unmarried man, Sir."

"Thure enough. Do you thill live on the old farm?"

"No, Sir; I've just arrived from Ohio, where I was born."

"Well, thir, I gueth I don't know you after all. Good morning, thir."
