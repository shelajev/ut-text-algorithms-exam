The young man, who was interested in natural history, was sitting on the
porch one June evening with his best girl, who was interested in music.
The rhythmic shrilling of the insects pulsed on the air, and from the
village church down the street came the sounds of choir practise. The
young man gave his attention to the former, the girl to the latter; and
presently she spoke eagerly:

"Oh, don't it sound grand!"

The young man nodded, and answered:

"Yes, indeed! and it's interesting to think that they do it all with
their hind legs."
