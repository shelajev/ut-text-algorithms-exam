FRENCH LANGUAGE


"I understand you speak French like a native."

"No," replied the student; "I've got the grammar and the accent down
pretty fine. But it's hard to learn the gestures."


In Paris last summer a southern girl was heard to drawl between the acts
of "Chantecler": "I think it's mo' fun when you don't understand French.
It sounds mo' like chickens!"--_Life_.
