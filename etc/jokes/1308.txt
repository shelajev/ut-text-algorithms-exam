During a conversation between an Irishman and a Jew, the Irishman asked
how it was that the Jews were so wise.

"Because," said the Jew, "we eat a certain kind of fish;" and he offered
to sell one for ten dollars.

After paying his money, the Irishman received a small dried fish. He bit
into it, then exclaimed: "Why, this is only a smoked herring."

"See?" said the Jew. "You are getting wise already."
