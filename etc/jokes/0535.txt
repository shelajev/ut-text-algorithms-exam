REMINDERS


The wife of an overworked promoter said at breakfast:

"Will you post this letter for me, dear? It's to the furrier,
countermanding my order for that $900 sable and ermine stole. You'll be
sure to remember?"

The tired eyes of the harassed, shabby promoter lit up with joy. He
seized a skipping rope that lay with a heap of dolls and toys in a
corner, and going to his wife, he said:

"Here, tie my right hand to my left foot so I won't forget!"
