The traveling salesman instructed the porter that he must leave the
train at Cleveland, where he was due at three o'clock in the morning. He
explained that violence might be necessary because he did not wake
easily. He emphasized his instructions with a generous tip.

The drummer awoke at six in the morning, with Cleveland far behind. In
a rage, he sought the porter. The colored man was in a highly disheveled
state and his face was bruised badly. His eyes popped at sight of the
furious traveling man, who allowed no opportunity for explanations or
excuses. He did all the talking, and did it forcibly. When at last the
outraged salesman went away, the porter shook his head dismally, and
muttered:

"Now, Ah shohly wonder who-all Ah done put off at Cleveland."
