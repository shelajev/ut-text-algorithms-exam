The new clergyman in the country parish, during his visit to an old lady
of his flock, inquired if she accepted the doctrine of Falling from
Grace. The good woman nodded vigorously.

"Yes, sir," she declared with pious zeal, "I believe in it, and, praise
the Lord! I practise it!"

The passing lady mistakenly supposed that the woman shouting from a

"Your mother is calling you," she said kindly.

The little girl corrected the lady:

"Her ain't a-callin' we. Us don't belong to she."
