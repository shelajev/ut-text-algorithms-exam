The little lad sat on the curb howling lustily. A passer-by halted to
ask what was the matter. The boy explained between howls that his father
had given him a licking. The sympathizer attempted consolation:

"But you must be a little man, and not cry about it. All fathers have to
punish their children sometimes."

The lad ceased howling long enough to snort contemptuously, and to
explain:

"Huh! my paw ain't like other boys' paws. He plays the bass drum in the
band!"

"What is your name?" demanded the judge of the prisoner in the Municipal
Court.

"Locke Smith," was the answer, and the man made a bolt for the door.

He was seized by an officer and hauled back.

"Ten dollars or ten days," said the magistrate.

"I'll take the ten dollars," announced the prisoner.

Finally, he paid the fine, but he added explicit information as to his
opinion of the judge. Then he leaped for the door again, only to be
caught and brought back a second time.

The judge, after fining the prisoner another ten dollars, admonished him
severely, in these words:

"If your language had been more chaste and refined, you would not have
been chased and refined."
