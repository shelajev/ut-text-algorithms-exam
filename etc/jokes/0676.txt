WOMAN


Woman--the only sex which attaches more importance to what's on its head
than to what's in it.


"How very few statues there are of real women."

"Yes! it's hard to get them to look right."

"How so?"

"A woman remaining still and saying nothing doesn't seem true to life."


    "Oh, woman! in our hours of ease
    Uncertain, coy, and hard to please"--
    So wrote Sir Walter long ago.
    But how, pray, could he really know?
    If woman fair he strove to please,
   Where did he get his "hours of ease"?

  --_George B. Morewood_.


MISS SCRIBBLE-"The heroine of my next story is to be one of those modern
advanced girls who have ideas of their own and don't want to get
married."

THE COLONEL (politely)-"Ah, indeed, I don't think I ever met that
type."--_Life_.


  You are a dear, sweet girl,
  God bless you and keep you--
  Wish I could afford to do so.


Here's to man--he can afford anything he can get. Here's to woman--she
can afford anything that she can get a man to get for her.--_George
Ade_.


  Here's to the soldier and his arms,
    Fall in, men, fall in;
  Here's to woman and her arms,
    Fall in, men, fall in!


Most Southerners are gallant. An exception is the Georgian who gave his
son this advice:

"My boy, never run after a woman or a street car--there will be another
one along in a minute or two."


  Here's to the maid of bashful fifteen;
  Here's to the widow of fifty;
  Here's to the flaunting, extravagant queen;
  And here's to the housewife that's thrifty.
   Chorus:
    Let the toast pass,--
    Drink to the lass,
  I'll warrant she'll prove an excuse for the glass.

  --_Sheridan_.
