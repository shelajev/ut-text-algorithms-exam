HAPPINESS


Lord Tankerville, in New York, said of the international school
question:

"The subject of the American versus the English school has been too much
discussed. The good got from a school depends, after all, on the
schoolboy chiefly, and I'm afraid the average schoolboy is well
reflected in that classic schoolboy letter home which said:

    "'Dear parents--We are having a good time now at school.
    George Jones broke his leg coasting and is in bed. We went
    skating and the ice broke and all got wet. Willie Brown was
    drowned. Most of the boys here are down with influenza. The
    gardener fell into our cave and broke his rib, but he can work
    a little. The aviator man at the race course kicked us because
    we threw sand in his motor, and we are all black and blue. I
    broke my front tooth playing football. We are very happy.'"


Mankind are always happier for having been happy; so that if you make
them happy now, you make them happy twenty years hence by the memory of
it.--_Sydney Smith_.
