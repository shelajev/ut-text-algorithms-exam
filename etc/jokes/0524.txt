REAL ESTATE AGENTS


Little Nelly told little Anita what she termed a "little fib."

ANITA--"A fib is the same as a story, and a story is the same as a lie."

NELLY--"No, it is not."

ANITA--"Yes, it is, because my father said so, and my father is a
professor at the university."

NELLY--"I don't care if he is. My father is a real estate man, and he
knows more about lying than your father does."
