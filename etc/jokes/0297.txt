GERMANS


The poet Heine and Baron James Rothschild were close friends. At the
dinner table of the latter the financier asked the poet why he was so
silent, when usually so gay and full of witty remarks.

"Quite right," responded Heine, "but to-night I have exchanged views
with my German friends and my head is fearfully empty."
