A Northern man in an optician's shop in Nashville overheard
an amusing conversation between the proprietor of the establishment and
an aged darkey who was just leaving the place with a pair of new
spectacles. As the old fellow neared the door his eye lighted upon an
extraordinary-looking instrument conspicuously placed upon a counter.
The venerable negro paused for several moments to gaze in open-mouthed
wonder at this thing, the like of which he had never seen before. After
a long struggle with his curiosity he was vanquished. Turning to the
optician, he asked: "What is it, boss?" "That is an opthalmometer,"
replied the optician in his gravest manner. "Sho," muttered the old man
to himself, as he backed out of the door, his eyes still fastened upon
the curious-looking thing on the counter. "Sho, dat's what I was afeared
it was!"
