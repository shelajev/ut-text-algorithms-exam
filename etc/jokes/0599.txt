A New Orleans lawyer was asked to address the boys of a business school.

when he steps into the arena of life. It was--"

"Pull," shouted the boys, in a roar of laughter, and the lawyer felt
that he had taken his text from the wrong side of the door.


  I'd rather be a Could Be
    If I could not be an Are;
  For a Could Be is a May Be,
    With a chance of touching par.
  I'd rather be a Has Been

  For a Might Have Been has never been,
    But a Has was once an Are.


  'Tis not in mortals to command success,
  But we'll do more, Sempronius,--
  We'll deserve it.

  --_Addison_.


There are two ways of rising in the world: either by one's own industry
or profiting by the foolishness of others.--_La Bruy√®re_.


  Success is counted sweetest
  By those who ne'er succeed.

  --_Emily Dickinson_.
