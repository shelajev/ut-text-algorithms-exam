The young mother asked the man who supplied her with milk if he kept any
calves, and smiled pleasedly when he said that he did.

"Then," she continued brightly, "bring me a pint of calf's milk every

The highly efficient housewife bragged that she always rose early, and
had every bed in the house made before anybody else in the house was up.


FORESIGHT

The master directed that the picture should be hung on the east wall;
the mistress preferred the west wall.

The servant drove the nail where his master directed, but when he was
left alone in the room he drove a nail in the other wall.

"That," he said to himself, "will save my lugging the steps up here
again to-morrow, when he has come around to agreeing with her."

shiftlessness of his colored workers, called sharply to two of the men

dis-heah plank."

"Plank? What plank? Where's the plank?" the foreman demanded.

The colored spokesman looked inquiringly and somewhat surprisedly at his
own empty hands and those of his companion, whom he addressed
good-naturedly:

"Now, if dat don't beat all, George! If we hain't gone an' clean
forgitted dat plank!"
