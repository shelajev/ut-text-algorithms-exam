The bellboy of the Welcome Hotel has invented an ingenious system of
calling sleepy guests. The other night a man left instructions that he
wished to be called early. Next morning he was disturbed by a loud
tattoo upon the door. "Well?" he demanded sharply. "I've got a message
for you, sir." Yawning until he strained his face, the guest jumped out
of bed and unlocked the door. The bellboy handed him an envelope and
then went away quickly. The guest opened the envelope, and took out a
slip of paper bearing the words: "It's time to get up."
