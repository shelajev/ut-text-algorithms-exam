The mother catechised her young son just before the hour for the arrival
of the music teacher.

"Have you washed your hands very carefully?"

"Yes, mother."

"And have you washed your face thoroughly?"

"Yes, mother."

"And were you particular to wash behind your ears?"

"On her side I did, mother."


COMMUNITY

The young man at the summer resort, who had become engaged to the pretty
girl, received information that led him to question her:

"Is it true that since you came up here you've got engaged to Billy, Ed,
George and Harry, as well as me?"

The young lady assumed an air of disdain.

"What is that to you?" she demanded.

"Just this," he replied gently. "If it's so, and you have no objection,
we fellows will all chip in together to buy an engagement ring."


COMPENSATION

Isaac and Moses dined in a restaurant that was new to them, and were
pained seriously by the amount of the check. Moses began to expostulate
in a loud voice, but Isaac hushed him with a whisper:

"'Sh! I haf the spoons in my pocket."


COMPLIMENTS

"Would you like a lock of my hair?" asked the gallant old bachelor of
the spinster who had been a belle a few decades past.

"Why don't you offer me the whole wig?" the maiden lady gibed, with a
titter.

The bachelor retorted with icy disdain:

"You are very biting, madam, considering that your teeth are porcelain."
