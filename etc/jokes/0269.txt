FLATS


"Hello, Tom, old man, got your new flat fitted up yet?"

"Not quite," answered the friend. "Say, do you know where I can buy a
folding toothbrush?"


She hadn't told her mother yet of their first quarrel, but she took
refuge in a flood of tears.

"Before we were married you said you'd lay down your life for me," she
sobbed.

"I know it," he returned solemnly; "but this confounded flat is so tiny
that there's no place to lay anything down."
