A worker in the steel mills applied direct to Mr. Carnegie for a holiday
in which to get married. The magnate inquired interestedly concerning
the bride:

"Is she tall or short, slender or plump?"

The prospective bridegroom answered seriously:

"Well, sir, I'm free to say, that if I'd had the rollin' of her, I sure
would have given her three or four more passes."


FRAUD

The hired man on a New England farm went on his first trip to the city.
He returned wearing a scarf pin set with at least four carats bulk of
radiance. The jewelry dazzled the rural belles, and excited the envy of
the other young men. His employer bluntly asked if it was a real
diamond.

"If it ain't," was the answer, "I was skun out o' half a dollar."


FRIENDSHIP

The kindly lady accosted the little boy on the beach, who stood with
downcast head, and grinding his toes into the sand and looking very
miserable and lonely indeed.

"Haven't you anybody to play with?" she inquired sympathetically.

The boy shook his head forlornly, as he explained:

"I have one friend--but I hate him!"
