The woman hesitated over buying the silver service.

"Of course," she said, "I take your word for it that it's solid silver,
but somehow it doesn't look it."

"A great advantage, ma'am," the shopkeeper declared suavely. "That
service can be left right out in plain sight, and no burglar will look
at it twice."


SANITY

It is a matter of uncommon knowledge that personal perfection is a most
trying thing to live with. In the United States recently, a woman sued
for divorce, alleging in the complaint against her husband that he had
no faults. It was probably a subtle subconscious realization of the
unpleasantness, even the unendurableness, of perfection in the domestic
companionship that caused the obvious misprint in the following extract
from a Scotch editorial concerning the new divorce legislation:

"But the Bill creates new grounds for the dissolution of the marriage
bond, which are unknown to the law of Scotland. Cruelty, incurable
sanity, or habitual drunkenness are proposed as separate grounds of
divorce."

The noted story-teller at a dinner party related an anecdote, and was at
first gratified by the hearty laughter of an old lady among the guests,
and later a little suspicious, as her mirth continued. As he stared at
her, puzzled, she spoke in explanation:

"Oh, that story is such a favorite of mine: the first time I heard it I
laughed so hard that I kicked the foot-board off my crib."
