Santa Claus inserted an upright piano, a fur dolman, a Ford, and a few
like knick-knacks in the Chicago girl's stocking. When he saw that it
was not yet half filled, he withdrew to the roof, plumped down on the
snow, and wept bitterly.


CHURCH

The young members of the family had been taught to be punctilious in
contributing to the collection at church. One Sunday morning, when the
boxes were being passed, James, aged six, ran his eye over those in the
pew, and noticed that a guest of his sister had no coin in her hand.
"Where is your money?" he whispered. She answered that she hadn't any.
But James was equal to the emergency:

"Here, take mine," he directed. "That'll pay for you. I'll get under the
seat."

Which he did.
