CHRISTMAS GIFTS


"As you don't seem to know what you'd like for Christmas, Freddie," said
his mother, "here's a printed list of presents for a good little boy."

Freddie read over the list, and then said:

"Mother, haven't you a list for a bad little boy?"

  'Twas the month after Christmas,
  And Santa had flit;
  Came there tidings for father
  Which read: "Please remit!"

  --_R.L.F_.


Little six-year-old Harry was asked by his Sunday-school teacher:

"And, Harry, what are you going to give your darling little brother for
Christmas this year?"

"I dunno," said Harry; "I gave him the measles last year."


  For little children everywhere
    A joyous season still we make;
  We bring our precious gifts to them,
    Even for the dear child Jesus' sake.

  --_Phebe Cary_.


  I will, if you will,
    devote my Christmas giving to the children and the needy,
      reserving only the privilege of, once in a while,
        giving to a dear friend a gift which then will have
          the old charm of being a genuine surprise.

  I will, if you will,
    keep the spirit of Christmas in my heart, and,
      barring out hurry, worry, and competition,
        will consecrate the blessed season, in joy and love,
          to the One whose birth we celebrate.
