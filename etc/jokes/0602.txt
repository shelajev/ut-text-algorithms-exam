SUMMER RESORTS


GABE--"What are you going back to that place for this summer? Why, last
year it was all mosquitoes and no fishing."

STEVE--"The owner tells me that he has crossed the mosquitoes with the
fish, and guarantees a bite every second."


"I suppose," said the city man, "there are some queer characters around
an old village like this."

"You'll find a good many," admitted the native, "when the hotels fill
up."
