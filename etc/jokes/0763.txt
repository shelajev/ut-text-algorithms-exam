A rustic visitor to the city made a desperate run for the ferry boat as
it was leaving the slip. He made a mighty leap, and covered the

the wide expanse of water between boat and shore.

"Holy hop-toads!" he exclaimed in a tone of profound awe. "What a jump!"

our bu$me$$. We are very mode$t and don't like to $peak about $uch
remi$$ne$$."

difficult study, and most perplexing."
