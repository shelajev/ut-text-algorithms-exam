WELCOMES


When Ex-President Taft was on his transcontinental tour, American flags
and Taft pictures were in evidence everywhere. Usually the Taft pictures
contained a word of welcome under them. Those who heard the President's
laugh ring out will not soon forget the western city which, directly
under the barred window of the city lockup, displayed a Taft picture
with the legend "Welcome" on it.--_Hugh Morist_.


  Come in the evening, or come in the morning,
  Come when you're looked for, or come without warning,
  Kisses and welcome you'll find here before you,
  And the oftener you come here the more I'll adore you.

  --_Thomas O. Davis_.
