LAUGHTER


TEACHER--"Freddie, you musn't laugh out loud in the schoolroom."

FREDDIE--"I didn't mean to do it. I was smiling, and the smile busted."


  Laugh and the world laughs with you,
  Weep, and the laugh's on you.


About the best and finest thing in this world is laughter.--_Anna Alice
Chapin_.
