POLICE


A man who was "wanted" in Russia had been photographed in six different
positions, and the pictures duly circulated among the police department.
A few days later the chief of police wrote to headquarters: "Sir, I have
duly received the portraits of the six miscreants. I have arrested five
of them, and the sixth will be secured shortly."


"I had a message from the Black Hand," said the resident of Graftburg.
"They told me to leave $2,000 in a vacant house in a certain street."

"Did you tell the police?"

"Right away."

"What did they do?"

"They said that while I was about it I might leave them a couple of
thousand in the same place."


Recipe for a policeman:

  To a quart of boiling temper add a pint of Irish stew
    Together with cracked nuts, long beats and slugs;
  Serve hot with mangled citizens who ask the time of day--
    The receipt is much the same for making thugs.
