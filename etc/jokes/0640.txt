TREASON


It was during the Parnell agitation in Ireland that an anti-Parnellite,
criticising the ways of tenants in treating absentee landlords,
exclaimed to Archbishop Ryan of Philadelphia: "Why, it looks very much
like treason."

Instantly came the answer in the Archbishop's best brogue: "Sure,
treason is reason when there's an absent 't'."


  Treason doth never prosper: what's the reason?
  Why if it prosper, none dare call it treason.
