CHURCH ATTENDANCE


"Tremendous crowd up at our church last night."

"New minister?"

"No it was burned down."


"I understand," said a young woman to another, "that at your church you
are having such small congregations. Is that so?"

"Yes," answered the other girl, "so small that every time our rector
says 'Dearly Beloved' you feel as if you had received a proposal!"


"Are you a pillar of the church?"

"No, I'm a flying buttress--I support it from the outside."
