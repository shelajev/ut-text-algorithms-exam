     "The naked hills lie wanton to the breeze,
       "The fields are nude, the groves unfrocked,
     "Bare are the shivering limbs of shameless trees,
       "What wonder is it that the corn is shocked?"

FAVORS

At the village store, the young farmer complained bitterly.

"Old Si Durfee wants me to be one of the pall-bearers once more at his
wife's funeral. An' it's like this. Si had me fer pall-bearer when his
first wife was buried. An' then agin fer his second. An' when Eliza
died, she as was his third, he up an' axed me agin. An' now, I snum,
it's the fourth time. An' ye know, a feller can't be the hull time
a-takin' favors, an' not payin' 'em back."


FIGHTING

The boy hurried home to his father with an announcement:

"Me and Joe Peck had a fight to-day."

The father nodded gravely.

"Mr. Peck has already called to see me about it."

The little boy's face brightened.

"Gee, pop! I hope you made out 's well 's I did!"

"Please, mum, I'se Ophelia. I'se de washerwoman's little girl, an' mama,
she sent me to say, would you please to len' her a dime. She got to pay
some bills."
