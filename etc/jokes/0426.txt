MOTORCYCLES


The automobile was a thing unheard of to a mountaineer in one community,
and he was very much astonished one day when he saw one go by without
any visible means of locomotion. His eyes bulged, however, when a
motorcycle followed closely in its wake and disappeared like a flash
around a bend in the road.

"Gee whiz!" he said, turning to his son, "who'd 'a' s'posed that thing
had a colt?"
