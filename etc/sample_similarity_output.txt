AERONAUTICS


  A flea and a fly in a flue,
  Were imprisoned; now what could they do?
    Said the fly, "let us flee."
    "Let us fly," said the flea,
  And they flew through a flaw in the flue.


The impression that men will never fly like birds seems to be
aeroneous.--_La Touche Hancock_.

NEW CAUSE OF IMPRISONMENT.


A COUNSEL having been retained to oppose a person justifying bail in the
Court of King's Bench, after asking some common-place questions, was
getting rather aground, when a waggish brother, sitting behind,
whispered him to interrogate the bail as to his having been a prisoner
in Gloucester gaol. Thus instructed, our learned advocate boldly asked,
"When, Sir, were you last in Gloucester gaol?" The bail, a reputable
tradesman, with astonishment declared that he never was in a gaol in his
life. The counsel persisted; but not being able to get any thing more
out of him, turned round and asked his friendly brother, for what the
man had been imprisoned? The answer was, "_For suicide_." Without
hesitation, he then questioned him thus: "Now, Sir, I ask you on your
oath, and remember I shall have your words taken down, were you not
_imprisoned_ in Gloucester gaol _for the crime of suicide_?"

COWS


Little Willie, being a city boy, had never seen a cow. While on a visit
to his grandmother he walked out across the fields with his cousin John.
A cow was grazing there, and Willie's curiosity was greatly excited.

"Oh, Cousin John, what is that?" he asked.

"Why, that is only a cow," John replied.

"And what are those things on her head?"

"Horns," answered John.

Before they had gone far the cow mooed long and loud.

Willie was astounded. Looking back, he demanded, in a very fever of
interest:

"Which horn did she blow?"


   There was an old man who said, "How
   Shall I flee from this horrible cow?
     I will sit on this stile
     And continue to smile,
   Which may soften the heart of that cow."

FATE


  Fate hit me very hard one day.
  I cried: "What is my fault?
  What have I done? What causes, pray,
  This unprovoked assault?"
  She paused, then said: "Darned if I know;
  I really can't explain."
  Then just before she turned to go
  She whacked me once again!

  So in the Libyan fable it is told
  That once an eagle stricken with a dart,
  Said, when he saw the fashion of the shaft,
  "With our own feathers, not by others' hands,
  Are we now smitten."

FROM PHOENIXIANA.


THE following recipe from the writings of Miss Hannah More, may be found
useful to your readers:

In a climate where the attacks of fleas are a constant source of
annoyance, any method which will alleviate them becomes a _desideratum_.
It is, therefore, with pleasure I make known the following recipe, which
I am assured has been tried with efficacy.

Boil a quart of tar until it becomes quite thin. Remove the clothing,
and before the tar becomes perfectly cool, with a broad flat brush,
apply a thin, smooth coating to the entire surface of the body and
limbs. While the tar remains soft, the flea becomes entangled in its
tenacious folds, and is rendered perfectly harmless; but it will soon
form a hard, smooth coating, entirely impervious to his bite. Should the
coating crack at the knee or elbow joints, it is merely necessary to
retouch it slightly at those places. The whole coat should be renewed
every three or four weeks. This remedy is sure, and having the advantage
of simplicity and economy, should be generally known.

So much for Miss More. A still simpler method of preventing the attacks
of these little pests, is one which I have lately discovered myself;--in
theory only--I have not yet put it into practice. On feeling the bite of
the flea, thrust the part bitten immediately into boiling water. The
heat of the water destroys the insect and instantly removes the pain of
the bite.

You have probably heard of old Parry Dox. I met him here a few days
since, in a sadly seedy condition. He told me that he was still
extravagantly fond of whiskey, though he was constantly "running it
down." I inquired after his wife. "She is dead, poor creature," said he,
"and is probably far better off than ever she was here. She was a
seamstress, and her greatest enjoyment of happiness in this world was
only so, so."
